# Subtitles to Andreas Antonopoulos videos

The goal of this project is simple - we want to help Andreas spread the word about new amazing technologies like Bitcoin or many other project based on Blockchain.

To achieve our goal, we decided to focus on translation of his best videos, to other languages - we belive, that this should help people, which do not speak English learn more about what is Bitcoin, how it works, what is Blockchain, and why all those questions are so important.

As you can read on [Andreas website](https://antonopoulos.com/donate/):

> _If you’re here, you’ve probably seen some of my work already and you realize how much time, money, and effort goes into producing original content with an independent perspective. What you might not know is that almost all of the content I produce is both free and open-source, and will remain so forever. It’s available under creative commons licenses; anyone can read and share the content for free. More importantly, anyone can re-use, mashup, **translate**, re-invent and even commercialize this work._

> _I use creative commons licensing because I believe in the commons, the community. I believe this technology can be a great equalizer and that people all around the world can become empowered by learning about this technology – we can change our own communities and build new organizations that can benefit us all. If you share this vision, and can afford to support it, then please do so.:_
