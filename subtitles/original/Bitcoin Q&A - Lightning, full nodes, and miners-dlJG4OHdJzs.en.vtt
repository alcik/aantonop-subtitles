Just one comment that you left, if I am allowed

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.540
That you said a segwit, no lighting, was bitcoin proof of stake.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.280
I just wanted, y'know, that.. How does everything sort of, feed into that and how things are gonna change..?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.280
Y'know, with all those questions? Umm, presented again, sorry. Babbling.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.240
Uh, that's something I said in the past. And, basically what i'm saying there is that lightning network involves doing local validation of the same consensus rules as bitcoin, has to be the same consensus rules..

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.920
But, you get to earn fees, by committing funds into a channel. That sounds VERY much like proof of stake to me.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:54.560
It represents a tremendous opportunity for, umm, users who want to run a bitcoin full node.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.000
It takes quite a lot of commitment, and data storage, and CPU, and RAM, and bandwidth.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.320
that probably about 5 to 15,000 users
you're running one right there I'm

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.100
running one as well great how many
people here are running a full node? 10

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.860
Wow go Singapore

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.729
it takes a big commitment and resources
and you don't get paid to do this how

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.840
many of you would be running a full node
if you could also run a lightning node

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.090
commit some Bitcoin to it and earn fees
on it and so now you see where that was

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.520
about 20 people so clearly incentives
matters lightning is one way we can

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.340
incentivize running full nodes fully
validating nodes and also full archive

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.349
nodes potentially that's going to be a
really important development in Bitcoin

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:06.720
and I'm very much in favor. Now you would
think that a group of miners that run

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.090
nodes that already collect all
transactions right already have to be

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.630
fully validating nodes, would look at
lightning Network and go hey we could

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.920
earn more fees using the same
infrastructure by running lightning

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.959
nodes we could be hubs for payments we
could extend into this space why are

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.690
they not doing that because lightning
Network and running full nodes is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.819
software and it requires maintenance
system administrators and security

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.130
professionals and configuration and
upgrades and all of the kinds of things

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.650
that you can simply get someone to rack
and mount hardware to do it's an alien

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.269
world it's not better it's not worse
it's just on the other side of that

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.030
culture divide that goes a long way to
explain why miners aren't jumping up and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.930
down and saying hey yeah I want to run
lightning we're going to be best

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.470
positioned to be running these hubs
because it's not the same as racking

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.050
mining hardware

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.010
you
