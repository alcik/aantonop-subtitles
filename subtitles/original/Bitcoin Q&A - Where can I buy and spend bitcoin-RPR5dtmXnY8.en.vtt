00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
[ORGANIZER 1] I was actually surprised when
last summer I went to MÃ¡laga, Spain,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.800
... and in a shopping centre, there was 
an ATM machine. It said, "Get your Bitcoin here"

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.070
or "Get your money here for Bitcoin."

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.720
[ORGANIZER 2] So what do they actually give you?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.520
[ORGANIZER 1] I didn't try.  I didn't 
have any, so I couldn't try.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.740
[ANDREAS] What the Bitcoin ATMs do is:

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.600
You hold up your smartphone device, which has 
a Bitcoin wallet, and it displays an address...

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.780
that can receive bitcoin. You show that to the ATM, 
and you put in some dirty old paper money,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.220
It spits bitcoin to your smartphone.  Done.  Pretty straightforward.  The best part is that the system...

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.070
is inherently secure because the ATM 
only knows how to send you money.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.420
Just like if someone has your email address, 
that doesn't mean they can read your email.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.820
That only means they can send you email. 
A similar principle to that.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.160
[ORGANIZER 1] And it works the 
other way around as well?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.520
[ANDREAS] Usually in most countries, it doesn't. Part of the reason for that is governments are terrified...

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.660
of the idea of creating a two-way network where 
you can change from bitcoin and back very easily.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.160
Yes. As a result, most of these devices are 
characterized as vending machines...

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.040
that sell you magic internet money.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.300
[ORGANIZER 1] Oh! That's fantastic.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.560
[ORGANIZER 2] But it's often described as- 
The big problem with bitcoin is that if you were early,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.740
cashed in early, and you have a lot of bitcoin, 
you might be a millionaire today in Bitcoin money.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.920
But where can you spend it?  How can you get 
dirty old paper money with your bitcoin?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.020
There's a lot of banks that won't give you the old money for it. Like you said, they usually will only go one way.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.980
[ANDREAS] Yes.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.700
[ORGANIZER] So am I just gonna hoard all this bitcoin until I feel like a millionaire?

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.300
Are we going to see a big change there soon?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.060
[ANDREAS] Well, when I first got into Bitcoin it was actually very difficult to buy anything.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.020
The first thing I bought was a pound of coffee beans, which I bought from a small store somewhere...

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.560
in the United States.  Based on my latest calculation, I paid $12,000 for a pound of coffee. [Laughter]

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.020
[ORGANIZER 2] Must have been some good coffee!

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.180
[ANDREAS] Nevertheless, those early moves help us build an economy. A lot of people think of bitcoin...

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.060
as something you buy and then sell, or invest in,
and that's the wrong way to think about it.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.160
I don't buy bitcoin. I haven't bought bitcoin since 2013.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.880
I earn bitcoin. I got paid bitcoin to come here. 
I get paid bitcoin to do all of my work.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.720
It's my primary source of income.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.100
All of my contractors get paid in bitcoin.  
All of my employees get paid in bitcoin.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.080
For example, this morning I sent my video 
editor a video that I recorded yesterday.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.020
Pretty much similar to what we're doing here today.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.960
They're in the Philippines. I sent them a bitcoin 
payment, which arrived in their bank account...

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.980
25 minutes later. 
You cannot do that with traditional banking.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.380
My contractor, they don't know that I'm using bitcoin.  
In this particular case, they received Filipino pesos.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.739
But that's not a problem. After a while, 
they pick up on what's happening.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.800
They ask, "Can you just send me bitcoin directly?"
The whole conversation changes.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.180
We're creating a closed economy where you can buy and sell things directly in bitcoin: flights, hotels,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.360
and things from Amazon. That's easy.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.140
But eventually, you have to think of 
bitcoin a bit like foreign currency.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.200
If you're on the internet as a tourist, you use bitcoin. 
If you're in Sweden, you use kronor.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.400
When you go on vacation to the internet 
or you want to buy something there,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.900
having a bit of bitcoin (the native currency) 
serves you well. Of course, there's many others.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.320
You may find lots of different options.
