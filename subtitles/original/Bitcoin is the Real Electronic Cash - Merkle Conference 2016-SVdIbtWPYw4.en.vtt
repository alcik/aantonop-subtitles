00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.580
Thank you.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.580
Hello everyone !

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.440
I want to make this presentation in French because it seems to me that the culture's minister, Audrey Azoulay,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.100
is committed to maintaining a top position

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.720
that the French-talking communities have in the world.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:37.840
I myself learned French at school and I feel really in ease to speak with you in Molière's language.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
In Voltaire's one…

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.020
But… not on the «&nbsp;Bitcoin&nbsp;» subject…

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.120
(Applause)

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.580
It tried to translate some of the words using Google

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:09.480
I asked, translate for me the word blockchain and google said
blocks [french] and that seemed a bit

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:18.150
strange and it said [french] block chain and
I thought isn't it la block chain and I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:28.049
asked what is block chain and google
said [french] I asked for the translation

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:36.360
of Bitcoin and it said [french] and finally
I said how do I explain the DAO to a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:47.759
French audience and they said just say
[french] and at that point I quit so I

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.840
will deliver the rest of this
presentation in English and I apologize

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.729
because I cannot really deliver in your
beautiful language that I spent many

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.979
years learning because of more than 20
years of lack of practice so I want to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.939
talk to you today about

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:19.550
a form of payments peer-to-peer payments
that are prolific a form of payments

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:29.110
that are near instantaneous transaction
free direct from person to person secure

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.130
convenience and have been around for
thousands of years in that form of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:47.209
payments is cash but cash won't be
around for thousands of years more cash

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:56.540
is going away and we haven't quite
considered the implications one of the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.040
beautiful things about cash is that it
enables a true peer-to-peer

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.390
person-to-person economy cash is the way
you transact in your local community

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:19.489
cash is the way you pay your small shop
your music teacher cash is the way you

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:27.100
pay the local farmer credit cards don't
work like that credit cards and bank

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.750
payment systems and mobile money in
paypal and venmo they're not

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.430
peer-to-peer they're not
person-to-person their person to

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.359
corporation to corporation to
corporation to person when did we invite

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:56.720
all of these corporations to participate
in our commerce as intermediaries when

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.090
did we invite them into every
conversation it feels the same but it

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.319
isn't when I go to the local bakery and
instead of cash I give them a credit

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:20.049
card to me it feels the same the
experience from my perspective is

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.600
person-to-person
and instantaneous convenience and

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.729
without fees but that is not the
experience that the Baker has the Baker

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:40.270
doesn't get paid the Baker doesn't get
paid sometimes for 30 days sometimes not

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.900
at all because fraud has occurred and
when they do get paid two percent of it

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.820
goes to someone who didn't add any value
to that transaction they just processed

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.820
it that is if that someone that
corporation decides they want to pay the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.150
Baker because if you come from a place
like Greece where I come from or from

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.940
Cyprus Argentina Venezuela Kazakhstan
Ukraine or many other countries in the

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:18.370
world one day the banks say no not your
money anymore you thought it was your

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:26.590
money it was alone and we just defaulted
and can't pay you back there's something

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:33.039
really magic about cash because as a
system of commerce it has allowed us for

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:39.729
thousands of years to interact quickly
conveniently with other people without

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.830
surveillance by governments without
corporations in between without fees

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:53.440
without any of those things and now we
stand in 2016 on the cusp of eradicating

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:02.889
in cash you hear the propaganda cash is
for criminals because after all who

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:09.940
would want to pay other people when it's
so easy to just pay corporations that

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.620
Bay corporations that pay corporations
that pay people I didn't invite them

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.849
into my transaction they invited
themselves and I don't like having to

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:28.240
make a system of commerce where it is
automatically assumed that as a human

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:38.479
being my main role is to be a consumer
not a producer of goods not a provider

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:44.919
of services because to be a provider or
producer I have to receive permission

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:52.400
apply for merchant accounts pay fees
it's so much easier to just be a

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.740
consumer it's so much easier to assume
that from now on everything that I ever

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.919
transact will be produced by a
corporation and my role is to just

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:09.379
consume and what does that do to our
society it destroys community it

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:17.590
destroys small shops it destroys
freelance entrepreneurs sole proprietors

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:25.279
workers it means that every interaction
you have is not with the person who made

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:31.159
your food it's with a person employed by
a corporation that outsources the making

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:39.110
of your fruit somewhere else and when I
bought meat from my butcher if one day

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:49.190
my butcher put wood chips saw wood fiber
into my meat I would go back and I would

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:58.729
go what the hell just happened why is
there wood chips in my needs but if an

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:05.509
executive at a corporation who aren't a
very prestigious mba sees a proposal

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:11.870
from a consultant that says fiber
enhancement of meat products plus two

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:19.189
percent profit and they sign someone a
thousand miles away puts wood chips in

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:25.870
your meat and when you go back to the
butcher they say I don't make it

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:32.329
complain to the corporation we're
destroying community by disengaging

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:37.849
commerce from something that happens
between people and introducing in every

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:43.819
transaction the idea that you must
always trade through a corporation that

00:08:43.819 --> 00:08:47.730
is your intermediary that you must
always lend

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:59.399
not pay deliver credit not value cash
has some unique characteristics cash is

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:05.760
a system that is a push transaction
meaning that I'm not authorizing someone

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.060
to take money out of my pocket I take
money out of my pocket and I push it to

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.519
the other person and the money they get
is the money I just pushed they don't

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:26.070
get to come back ten days later and make
another debit from my pocket how did we

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.470
suddenly change that every system of
payment in our society as a pull system

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:36.089
how did we suddenly change where every
transaction I make I am authorizing

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:41.940
someone not only to take money now but
maybe take money again and again or

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:51.050
maybe lose my access controls and some
hacker can take money again and again

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.160
cash is a bearer instrument that means
the value is in the instrument itself

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.019
it's not a promissory note it doesn't
represent a promise that you will be

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:08.970
paid later it is a bearer instrument
which means you are paid now and the

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:16.800
thing about promises is that promises
can be broken cash doesn't represent the

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:24.029
issuance of debt it represents the
transmission of value cash is

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:31.529
instantaneous you get the value and can
spend it immediately not 30 days from

00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:39.449
now let me ask a quick question if I
wanted to give you five euros for coffee

00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:48.569
how many of you will take visa today? No
one? You mean the only way i can pay

00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:54.149
other human beings is with cash the
thing that we are about to make illegal

00:10:54.149 --> 00:11:01.320
because apparently an ancient technology
for human payments

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:08.340
could only possibly be used by criminals
the definition of a criminal is anyone

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:19.380
who isn't a corporation, pretty much so
what is Bitcoin what are these open

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.270
global blockchains that we're talking
about what is so special about Bitcoin

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:30.710
or Ethereum or any of the other systems
that are open global borderless neutral

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:36.900
payment systems that allow open access
open innovation access without

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:44.910
permission participation from anyone
anywhere in the world Bitcoin was

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.830
created by Satoshi Nakamoto and in the
title of his paper he said a

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:59.880
peer-to-peer system of electronic cash
cash this is not an electronic bank

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:07.110
account this is not an electronic bank
this is not a digital credit card this

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:15.240
is not an electronic payments network
this is electronic cash and it has all

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.760
of the unique characteristics of cash
that make it so precious it is

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:26.540
peer-to-peer i can pay anyone in this
room five euros equivalent in bitcoin

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:36.450
like that not here to corporation to
peer person to person directly i can

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:42.030
engage in trade with every person in my
community directly when i pay someone it

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:47.250
is a push transaction which means that
they receive the value immediately and

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:52.920
they cannot charge me again for more
value later they have no access or

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.910
authorization to my accounts. I didn't transfer access i transferred value a

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:06.630
bearer instrument that transmission
happens near instantaneously you can

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:12.470
spend a Bitcoin transaction five or ten
seconds after i send it to you it

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.180
happens for
almost no fees at all just a few pennies

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:24.130
just to cover the network costs and it
allows us to do everything that cash has

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:32.320
allowed us to do for thousands of years
oh except for one thing this form of

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:41.470
cash i can send to kuala lumpur in five
seconds, why? why the hell not? because I

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:50.410
want to I can send it across borders I
can send it to a farmer in Kenya to a

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:56.860
fisherman in Indonesia I can send it to
someone in South Africa, why? why the hell

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:02.290
not? it's my money I want to trade with
the world I am a citizen of the world

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:10.990
and with a form of electronic cash I get
all of the benefits of cash plus I can

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:17.440
email it across the world in a few
seconds bitcoin is a very important

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:24.280
technology because it enables us to
re-engage with a concept of using money

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:30.040
as a form of payment between people not
corporations it allows us to engage in

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:37.390
commerce without surveillance without
corporate interaction without blocks on

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:46.560
my accounts without freezes and fees and
compromises and theft and corruption it

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.940
means that my money is not sitting in a
bank being re-loaned to some war

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:58.450
criminal somewhere using it to bomb some
country it's my money not somebody

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:05.020
else's money it's not a loan without
interest to the banking system it's my

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:14.500
money it's cash in my pocket this is an
interesting principle really the idea

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:24.390
that you can bring money back to three
basic core principles:

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:30.050
Liberté, fraternité, égalité
 thank you
