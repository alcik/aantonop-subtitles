00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.660
[QUESTIONER]: Banks, they play a huge role in our economy. [ANDREAS]: So far. [QUESTIONER]: So far.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.240
What is going to happen with them?
What is going to be the bank's role in 2018?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.799
Are they going to disappear?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.760
[ANDREAS]: No, they're not gonna disappear.
If you go to Central Park, New York...

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.860
You go there with your wife or your significant other,
and you're visiting Central Park,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.900
they have these beautiful horse carriages 
that you can ride around Central Park in.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.620
Apparently, horse carriages didn't disappear 
with the invention of the automobile.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.880
So banks won't either. They'll be the kind
of institution that has significantly less power,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.200
and is mostly used for legacy applications.
Maybe governments will use them more.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.960
[QUESTIONER]: That's actually what they're doing
right now, with the blockchain that they're building.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.440
The centralised blockchain.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.860
[ANDREAS]: Well, the centralised blockchain
is a contradiction in terms.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.480
The purpose of a blockchain is to
increase decentralisation.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.720
A centralised blockchain is like
a horseless carriage with a horse.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.280
If you do a horseless carriage 
with a horse, that's a horse carriage...

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.740
and we already have those,
so you didn't really change anything.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.500
It's like saying, "The technology behind
 the automobile is the pneumatic tire."

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.520
"Let's adopt pneumatic tires
and put horses in front of them."

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.960
It won't work. Now, I hope they spend
another billion dollars trying to figure out

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.520
.. that it won't work, training lots and lots
 of blockchain engineers who will eventually

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.759
.. come to Bitcoin and Ethereum,
and do some interesting projects.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.120
But banking as an institution is obsolete.
Banking is now a protocol, banking is an app.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.160
That world is never going to go back.
It just may take 20-30 years until you see

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.740
.. that ripple through the world. But it will,
and there's absolutely nothing that can stop it.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.980
[QUESTIONER]: In Sydney, there's a lot of
talk about blockchain, because there's a lot

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.000
.. of fear from the banks. They're investing
a lot of money in the ecosystem. [ANDREAS]: Yes.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.760
[QUESTIONER]: How can we use the fear from
the banks to make sure we build the ecosystem

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.380
.. and do all the great things that we want to do?

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.500
[ANDREAS]: Oh, we don't need to persuade
the banks to do this right.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.700
They're putting hundreds of millions of dollars into things that, as they're building them now,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.240
won't work. Absolutely. They're training
tens of thousands of developers on

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.180
.. how blockchains work. There are [only] a few very
interesting, open, borderless, decentralised,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.440
.. open innovation, open permission blockchains.
I'm hoping the best of the best of these developers -

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.000
after getting bored for a couple of years 
doing proof-of-concept on reinventing spreadsheets -

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.860
will take their Christmas bonus, and on
January 1st use it to fund a startup

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.260
.. to compete against the banks
that taught them how to do this.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.820
I've seen this! I've talked to people from these banks, telling me, "I got my Christmas bonus on January 1st."

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.900
"I started a Bitcoin startup to
compete against my former employer."

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.240
This is going to happen. The beauty is: 
we just cracked the market wide open.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.060
When it comes to an open market,
competition will determine the outcome.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.680
If you continue to build horse buggies
in the age of the automobile, you go out of business.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.040
Simple as that, and most of them will.
The dinosaurs will survive, but they will

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.340
.. but they will change and lose enough power
until they become chickens.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.240
That's what happened to the dinosaurs. [laughter]
We have their children for breakfast every morning!
