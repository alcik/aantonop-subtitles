00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.999
A couple weeks ago, Jamie Dimon

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.240
criticized Bitcoin.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.670
Could you encapsulate,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:17.309
briefly, what his criticism was and then how you would rebut it? Because I'm very interested in the topic.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.830
I believe his specific criticism was, and I may paraphrase, that Bitcoin is a fraud, that has no financial

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.579
basis and is not backed by anything.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.500
That was the criticism by Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan Chase,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.720
who actually got fined

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.960
2 billion dollars for mortgage fraud, which

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.379
JPMorgan Chase paid

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.409
by committing more mortgage fraud

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.389
I don't know if you've seen that news, that was particularly fascinating. And they did this all on the dollar,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.149
which is backed by... oh.. right

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.940
So,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.300
You know, I think my, my most honest reaction is Jamie doth protest too much methinks, and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.300
It's interesting how the head of the largest investment bank in the world

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.200
finds time in his very, very busy day to speak about a nothing,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.520
an irrelevant little technology that has no impact on the world

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.190
It's almost

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400
disconcerting that he would pay so much attention

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.720
By the way, as he was saying that, JPMorgan traders were buying Bitcoin, so I

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.340
I will give you a prediction which I've made before.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.000
The world's banks have never faced competition from the internet.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.259
They need to learn really quickly that when the internet comes for your industry,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.619
It doesn't end well. Look at all the other industries that face the intense competition from the internet

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.399
Well, the Internet is now coming for banking and the result of that will be that

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.969
Banks, and their executives will not only lose their industry or their power in the industry,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.460
But they will go through the five stages of grief.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.680
Denial, anger, bargaining

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.130
Depression and acceptance.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.729
It starts with denial.  Bitcoin can't possibly work. It will surely crash any second now. Nine years later,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.730
That's not working, so well

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.139
Anger - terrorists! Drug dealers!

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.660
Pornographers!  Make it stop!

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.720
That's not working, because the governments figure out you can't make it stop.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.340
Bargaining! We like blockchain, but not Bitcoin

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.360
hmm, doesn't work so well, and so on and so forth. The Internet is coming for banking and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.700
Like every industry before it, the industry heads think "we will weather this storm,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.180
After all, we've been doing this for centuries"

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.580
Good luck. I hope you keep that attitude until the very end
