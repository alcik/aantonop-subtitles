00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
I want to talk about the decentralization of truth and, thank you, Elyse.  You gave me a fantastic opening for

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.519
today's talk.  So how many of you are in Bitcoin for -
 or in cryptocurrencies for less than a year?

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.299
Okay.  Maybe about

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.379
a fifth of the audience. Now, this is something that keeps happening.  Like if you keep going to these events, what you'll notice is that

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.879
a percentage of the people you meet is always new.  Why?

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.569
Because we're growing at an exponential pace. The entire community, the entire industry, all of the cryptocurrencies

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.059
the engagement is growing at an exponential pace.  So most of the people who come into this are new.  Okay.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.339
So here's how it works.  You come into this space

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.089
and you've heard about this weird nerdy thing called Bitcoin - maybe.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.090
A lot of people come in through Bitcoin as their first experience in cryptocurrency

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.989
and you start asking questions, and none of it makes any

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.660
freaking sense.  None of it.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.039
"Who runs this thing?"

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.689
"Nobody."

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.360
"Okay, okay. I get you - nobody - but, but, but just, just tell me.  I mean come on.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.379
Who runs this thing?

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.720
Like you've been in here, in this space for since 2012.  Obviously you know who runs this thing."

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.059
"How does it work?  What is it backed by?  Why does it have value?"

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.479
"What's going on?"

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.630
And all of these questions come in, right, and you're like "This isn't like the money I know.  This isn't

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.759
like anything I know."  And none of the answers make sense at first.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.859
And gradually you start climbing up this very steep learning curve

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.869
and it's full of traps because you see the peak and you're like "I'm almost there.  I'm beginning to understand.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.060
I'm having this breakthrough moment.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.810
I can finally understand what the hell everybody's talking about - barely -  but just a bit."  And you reach that peak and you're like "I made it!"

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.229
And you look up and it's not the final peak.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.829
It's just a plateau and you have to start climbing again because "Okay, I kind of understand

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.729
Bitcoin, but now I'm hearing about this blockchain thing

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.289
and Hyperledger and distributed ledger technologies.  More questions.  More questions

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.030
about that, and then alt coins. "What the hell are alt coins? There's thousands of them?  When did this happen?

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.809
I just understood Bitcoin and you're gonna dump a thousand other things in my lap!"  Here go again, climbing up the steep learning curve

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.720
and you get alt coins, and then just when you think you're beginning to understand it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.500
some kid with a funny name

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.130
builds a platform that can allow anyone to write an ICO in three minutes, and suddenly the whole place is flooded with

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.009
ICOs and here we go again. "What the hell are all these things? Are they coins?
  Are they blockchains?"

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.950
No.  They're a platform of a coin on top of another platform

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.859
which uses smart contracts.  "What the hell's a smart contract?"  And here we go climbing up the learning curve again.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.299
And just when you think you're beginning to understand, and you look back, and you're like "Okay, Bitcoin. I got that covered.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.850
At least I understand that.

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.579
What do you mean it's forking? (audience laughs)

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.819
What the hell is a fork?

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.550
Now what do I do?

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.129
Do I get part of the fork?  If I have the fork am I on both sides of the fork?

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.309
How can I be on both sides of the fork, and if I am on both sides of the fork

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.940
how do I spend it?  Which one do I spend?  Which one is the real Bitcoin?

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.090
What, it's forking again? (audience laughs)

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.730
Didn't it just fork like two weeks ago?

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.479
Okay, we're forking again.  Here we go again. Okay, freak out. How do I get this fork? What about the next one?

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.819
And the next one, and the next one?  What if it's forks all the way down?

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.099
What if it's a bottomless forking mechanism?  What if forking is what it's all about? (audience laughs)

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.970
Maybe I missed this.  Are we ICOing Bitcoin now?  I'm totally confused. I thought I had it,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.009
I lost it again."

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.799
And in all of this you're trying to find an anchor, something familiar, something you can grasp, something that will give you

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.239
a basis to understand what the hell is going on with this technology.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360
And this is the trap.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.990
Because

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.580
we've grown up

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.609
believing a certain model,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.190
a model for discovering truth.  And the model we have for discovering truth

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.960
is authority.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.190
And so when we're suddenly trying to figure out "What is the truth? What is really happening in this space?"

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.239
what do we instinctively do?  Instinctively we look for authority.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.460
"Hang on.  Didn't Andreas say this is a leaderless movement?

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.190
But who's the authority then?  Who tells us what's true?  How the hell do we find out what's true if there's no leader?"

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.100
And inevitably

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.620
someone pops out of the bushes and goes "I'll be the leader!"

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.980
I'm sorry, we weren't advertising a vacancy when we said leaderless movement. (laughs)

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.540
We actually want it to remain leaderless.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.249
So you look at all of these things, and some people tell you Bitcoin Cash is the new Bitcoin - is the real Bitcoin.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.989
Or is it Bitcoin 1X that's the real Bitcoin,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.109
or is it this new 2X, or Bitcoin Gold, or whatever the next fork is going to be.  Which one - "Can the real

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.970
Bitcoin stand up?  Can somebody tell me which one is the real Bitcoin?"

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.420
There is no real Bitcoin. There is no objective truth.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.810
There is no final authority.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.600
There will be no answer.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:02.489
No one can tell you.  And the reason no one can tell you is because we cannot appeal to an authority.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.799
We're so used to looking for someone to tell us.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.779
And why do we need that answer?  Why do we need to know which one is the real Bitcoin?

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.440
Because clearly if one of them's real, that's the only one that has value - right?

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.480
Value comes from

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.070
authenticity

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.070
or does it?

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.830
"What's in a name?  If we didn't call it a rose, would it not smell as sweet?"
(Shakeaspeare's quote from Romeo and Juliet)

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:42.120
What is in a name?  Is it the authenticity that gives it value, or is it value that gives it authenticity?

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.900
Where does the value come from?

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.000
And we don't know how to handle this because it's never happened before.  So let me give you

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.410
a question here.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.439
How can you tell what a real dollar is?

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.800
Right?

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.630
It's got a stamp on it,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.279
some kind of fancy serial numbers. 
 Maybe you can tell  - put it under light,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.840
mark it with a marker. "Okay, this is the real one." What does it say on the front?

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.479
Does it say "one dollar"?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.399
No, it doesn't. You haven't actually read it.  It says "Federal Reserve Note".

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.949
The stuff you're holding in your wallet is an imposter. It's a forgery of a silver certificate.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:32.979
It used to be a silver certificate.  Those days are over.  Now it's a Federal Reserve Note. What's that?

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:36.699
Does it matter

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.330
whether it's a real dollar?  Let's play a little mental exercise.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.850
Overnight

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.770
all of your

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:51.460
dollars got replaced by forgeries.  You wake up the next day and you have forged dollars in your wallet

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:55.239
but nobody seems to notice except you.  You know they're forged.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:02.139
You know everybody else's are forged.  You can see them handing you forged dollars, and everybody seems to not notice that they're forged.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:08.469
What happens to the value of the system?  What happens to the value of the dollar if tomorrow morning all of them were forged?

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.830
Nothing.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.440
Continues to have the exact same value.  As long as we all

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.620
believe in the new thing, it has the exact same value.  It doesn't matter who printed it.

00:08:21.349 --> 00:08:23.409
So what does it matter

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:30.249
which is the real one?  Where does value come from?  It doesn't come from authenticity, and it doesn't come from

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:32.360
authority.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.360
It comes from use.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.009
If we use the thing, then it is the real thing as far as we're concerned.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.059
That's all that matters.  And the value comes from the use.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:49.869
It's not valuable as a dollar because it has the stamp.  Really, that's only about

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.740
making sure that not too many of them are printed.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.709
You only care about it being authentic

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:02.589
because you don't want the market suddenly flooded with it, at which point it starts losing value.

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:09.249
What happens when the authority that has stamped it is the one flooding the market by printing more and more of them?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.500
Now we have a bit of a conundrum.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.469
Which one is the real?  It doesn't matter.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.620
So when you ask yourself which is the real

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:26.010
Bitcoin, you're looking for authenticity.  And the problem with looking for authenticity is that the only way you can have authenticity

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.420
is through authority.  You need someone to step up and tell you,

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:37.439
make that decision for you, tell you which is real and which isn't, which fork to follow

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.280
and which is the chain that matters, which one will keep its value.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.130
And no one can tell you that.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.369
Because the only Bitcoin that matters

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.410
is the one that you choose to validate. 
 If you're running a node, and you

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:58.319
choose the rules of consensus that you follow, that is the real Bitcoin to you and you alone.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.820
There is no objective truth. There is only empirical

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.500
subjective truth.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.929
Do you know that everybody else is making the same decision?  No.  For that

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:15.540
you need a market, and what the market does is it takes every single person's

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.839
subjective opinion of which one is the real Bitcoin

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.510
and then puts a price on it

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.309
and collects all of the decisions you make, one by one, each person

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.690
deciding whether to sell or buy, at what price to sell and buy,

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.370
and creates this emergent picture of value that tells you

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:44.040
I don't know what the real one is but this is what people think is the real one because they reflect that in their decisions.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.800
So the ideal way to do that, to maintain the real Bitcoin,

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:55.679
is to run your own node and validate your own consensus rules, and how many in this room do that?

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.969
15 people out of 275.  That's not gonna cut it.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:09.959
And what most of us do is we delegate this decision.  We say "Okay, if I choose a wallet

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.959
by a team that professes to share my principles and values

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:23.879
and follows the same kind of rules about Bitcoin that I think make the real Bitcoin, then by proxy

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.790
I am expressing my

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.340
opinion about what is truth, what is real

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:36.239
which one is the real Bitcoin."  And this is not just a problem in Bitcoin. I mean, is it Ethereum or Ethereum Classic?

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.450
By show of hands:  Ethereum,

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.249
Classic, Ethereum, Classic. (audience laughs)

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.600
Which is real?

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.969
Funnily enough, people who are

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:56.520
indoctrinated to authority, what we look for is some kind of protection of authenticity.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.669
"Sue those bastards for trademark infringement!"

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.839
"They're trying to steal the brand."

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:11.820
That is old school thinking.  That is the basis of old currencies. We are no longer in a zero-sum game.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.510
Here's the bad news.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.580
We would have our

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.419
answer if one of these things survived

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:28.080
and the others simply went away - they died.  Right?  Like it would be fantastic if

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.599
one currency - the real one -

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.859
emerged as a victor and eventually the others

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.819
disappeared.  In order for one to win

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.730
something has to lose and lose in such a way that it disappears.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.719
None of these things are ever going to disappear.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:55.830
As long as there are two people running the consensus algorithm, the coin continues.  There are coins from 2012

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.659
from the very early alt coin boom that are still around.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.930
Nobody knows what they are anymore, but they're still around and they might be around forever.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:14.609
So we have a thousand block chains today, and in a few years

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:20.430
we'll have 10,000, and then we'll have a hundred thousand, and then we'll have a million, and then we'll have

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.970
10 million, and none of them will ever die

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.249
because somewhere, probably

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.730
in a cabin in Montana

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.599
with a satellite dish and a raspberry pie there'll be the one die-hard user

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.640
of

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.299
Bitcoin Flooze or whatever the latest fork is - is going to be like "This is the real one, and

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.799
you can take it away out of my cold dead hands!"

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.879
And so that one will exist forever.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.420
There will be no winner

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.090
because this is not a competition of

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.270
elimination, because this is not

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:08.599
game season, this is not the World Series. This is not a knockout match.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.330
This is a system in which everybody can choose to follow their own path,

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:21.500
create their own coin, and therefore there will be thousands, and then hundreds of thousands, and then millions, and it doesn't matter

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:28.700
which is the real one because there is no absolute truth. There is no objective answer.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.190
We have to become

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.060
accustomed to uncertainty.  We have to understand

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:41.509
that they will all exist, and the only thing that matters is which one do you choose to use

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.560
because the value doesn't come from it being authentic,

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.559
authorized, annointed, or winning. It comes from being used.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.109
Use value is the only value.  And then suddenly you realize

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.830
all currencies are like that.  None of them have intrinsic value.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.640
None of them matter in terms of authority.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.410
They only matter in terms of use.  Turns out the Euro, the Yen, the

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:17.150
US dollar, they all only have value not because the government said so but because we believed,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:25.610
and they will only have value as long as we believe.  Even that authority is fake.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.910
Even that money

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.910
is fake.  It's an illusion.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:39.410
All that matters is what do we choose to use.  There is no authenticity.  There is no objective truth.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.820
Here's the danger.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:48.860
People are very uncomfortable with this idea.  They want an answer.  They want a simple

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:57.349
objective truth that they can cling to and say "This is the real one", and they'll never get that, so they'll delegate their

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.970
responsibility to others.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.830
They'll say "Eh, let Coinbase decide.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:11.300
Let the hosted wallet, the exchange decide for me.  Whatever fork they support is my fork."

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.960
delegating that responsibility.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.259
There is this very dangerous moment

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.510
when the companies that

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.810
have successfully grown in this space

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.070
forget

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.270
that they serve their users,

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.970
they do not represent

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.589
their users.  They did not receive an electoral mandate

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:42.020
by having 10 million users to represent those users and

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.850
consensus to be their elected representatives through business.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.300
They serve customers. They are not served by their customers.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.409
And over the last couple of years, in fact, we've watched that gradual slide as people who started serving customers

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.000
started believing

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.560
that they had a mandate to represent their customer base, to make decisions about

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:17.569
consensus, and to impose those decisions on everybody else.  That is a very dangerous path.  It is the path, as

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.330
Elyse was alluding to, of centralization.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.120
If you give up your

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.269
responsibility to choose based on your principles

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:31.700
and you give that power to someone else, just like giving your keys to someone else,

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.110
you are no longer

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.390
participating in the community, you are no longer participating in consensus, you are no longer

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.420
expressing your principles through choice.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:49.070
You are delegating to central authority, and it all goes to shit from there

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.380
very, very fast because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:03.230
Do not make the mistake of looking for a simple answer, a straightforward authority that will tell you which is the real one.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.040
They're all real.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.810
They're all fake. There is no difference between real and fake.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.840
Which is the useful one?

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.020
Which is the empowering one?

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.829
Which is the one that expresses your principles?

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.839
Which is the one that achieves the things you want to see in the world?

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.470
Is that real enough for you?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:34.340
Follow that, and let the market aggregate all of those opinions so you can express your choice.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
There will be no winners

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:43.609
but together we can all make sure that by making these choices ourselves,

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:51.919
by taking control of our keys, by taking control of the consensus when we can, and by expressing that opinion,

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:58.940
we won't arrive at a final truth, but we'll put our little two cents

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.770
our choice into the market.  We'll inject it and hope that the market

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.420
reflects that

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.420
so that we can have something that

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:16.489
persists, that is resistant to censorship, that is neutral, that is open, that is empowering for

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.370
individuals, and that cannot be easily

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.980
hijacked.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.440
What we are doing is we are decentralizing truth.  Thank you.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.720
You
