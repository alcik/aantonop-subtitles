QUESTIONER: Hi.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.060
So my question's really

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.180
if you look at, you know, back to FDR

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.760
executive order 6102

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.920
confiscation of gold

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.460
once this thing will happen

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.620
- and I think it will eventually happen -

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.200
what prevents the government, let's say

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200
to take control of the exchanges

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.160
which basically store all the information, who has what

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.180
and then back to executive order 6102?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.240
ANDREAS: Well, they can take over the exchanges.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.480
They won't get much of the bitcoin

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.480
because all of you have learned from coming to these events

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.360
that you do not store your bitcoin

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.020
long-term on exchanges.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.620
Your keys, your coins.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.700
Not your keys, not your coins.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.240
They may discover information about

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.980
who has used exchanges

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.360
and

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.640
maybe if you buy bitcoin on an exchange

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.640
they may come after you and ask you to

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.460
provide that bitcoin.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.300
And what that will do is it will drive the entire economy underground

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.419
so you will no longer be able to use your bank accounts to buy bitcoin

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.480
but, guess what?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.640
At that point, you can't use your bank account to buy bitcoin

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.800
because no one wants your stinking dollars anymore.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.980
And at that point you have to do something else.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.080
You have to start bartering for your services.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.980
So you have to offer services or products that are useful to other people

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.600
and get bitcoin for those from the few of us

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.100
who got paid for our bitcoin and didn't buy it on an exchange

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.060
and still have some.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880
What it's also gonna do as soon as they do that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.620
is it's going to increase the spread

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.440
between bitcoin and the national currency

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.760
- anywhere they do this.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.160
As soon as you ban it, the spread increases.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.440
When the spread goes to 25%,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.600
who does that go to?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.800
Who gets paid that 25%?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.600
Whoever is able to inject bitcoin into the market

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.740
which becomes a fantastic motivator

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.500
for people to start smuggling bitcoin into the country.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.980
Right?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.880
And they will

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.700
just like has happened in Venezuela,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.800
just like happened in India,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.740
just like happened in all of these other countries.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.940
So then the people who are smuggling

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.500
bitcoin into the country

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.940
which, really, you don't really need to smuggle bitcoin

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.580
because it's everywhere

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.720
so it's relatively easy to do.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.300
They get a 25% premium.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.640
And what do they use that 25% premium to do?

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.380
They widen the routes by which they've been smuggling money in

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.320
and try to bring more money in

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.240
and as long as that premium persists

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.840
that route keeps getting wider and wider and wider

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.600
and a bigger flow of money starts pouring in.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.520
Right?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.920
Because think of physics.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.520
Right?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.580
I don't know if any of you like physics.  I love physics.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.740
Potential energy.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.160
You've got a fantastic difference in potential energy

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
between the two sides of the border.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.660
Right?

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.780
And that will cause bitcoin to flow downhill

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.240
into the area where it has a 25% premium

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.780
and until the two levels are equalized

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.960
it will continue to flow very, very fast.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.220
The bigger the difference, the more it will flow

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.540
and the more you push it down

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.940
in the inside country,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.300
the more you make the difference

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.340
and you drive flows in there.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.080
So it will drive a giant underground market.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.880
And, of course, at that point they have to enforce the law.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.660
So, how can you tell if the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.860
person who is enforcing executive order

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.980
'ban all bitcoin' who comes and knocks on your door

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.520
can be bribed or not?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.820
Well, a good litmus test is if they take bitcoin

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.260
they're bribable.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.960
So you start bribing them in the illegal currency.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.720
Now, that may sound funny to you

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.100
but this is exactly what happened in Russia in 1984

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.640
- in the Soviet Union.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.480
1984, they banned private ownership

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.800
of hard currency, foreign currency, like dollars.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.240
Who were the first people to fill suitcases with hard currency?

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.860
The politburo.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.740
The people who signed their name on the law.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.500
Of course - right?

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.960
And then how did you know if the cop was bribable or not?

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.780
Well, if they take dollars

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.080
they're simultaneously committing two crimes :

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.080
currency crimes and bribery crimes.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.820
If they're double the amount of criminal

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.940
you can probably trust them to engage in the conspiracy of

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.680
of allowing you to hold foreign currency.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.260
So, now, all of the cops that were corrupt

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.060
started asking only for US dollars as their bribes.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.540
Within a year

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.100
the amount of hard currency flowing into Russia

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.100
had quadrupled.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.460
And this is what just happened in Venezuela.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.780
And it's also what happened in India.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.900
For the second time

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.900
- this has happened twice -

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.020
it happened with the Silk Road, it happened in India -

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.660
they just announced yesterday

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.940
the Bank of India is now investigating

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.060
a drug enforcement agent

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.140
who shut down a bitcoin drug ring

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.360
and then stole the bitcoin

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.660
and appropriated it for himself

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.040
which is exactly what happened with the Silk Road

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.440
when two DEA agents ended up stealing the bitcoin.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.720
The siren call of hard money.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.140
Irresistible.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.680
What it does is it creates this enormous wave of corruption

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.540
and that wave of corruption will swallow everything.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.980
So you can write the law, you can sign the law

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.500
but if breaking that law

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.400
or obeying that law is the difference between

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.900
I send my kids to the hospital,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.400
I send my kids to school,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.060
I feed my kids,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.480
as it is in Venezuela,

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.520
no one gives a damn about the law

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.920
and nothing you can do to them will stop them.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.720
And so, as a result, all it does is make a mockery of the law.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.980
This happens in gradual stages, of course.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.880
It doesn't happen all at once.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.800
Let them confiscate the exchanges.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.160
They're going to create exactly the premium

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.660
that's going to drive an enormous black market.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.420
"Black market" is just another word for unofficial market.
