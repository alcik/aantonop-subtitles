00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
[QUESTIONER:] According to what you said,
Bitcoin is possibly going to be banned

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.280
.. in the next year, or very strictly controlled.
[ANDREAS:] In some places, yes.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.780
[QUESTIONER:] For instance, one of these
places could be China. [ANDREAS:] Unlikely, but yes.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.220
[QUESTIONER:] Because they are really having
a lot of problems, with many people converting

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.880
.. their money from bitcoin. And I think
70% of the mining facilities are in China.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.460
So do you think they are going to try to control
the mining facilities? What are the possible outcomes?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.520
[ANDREAS:] That's a great question. So do I
think mining will be controlled in China or do

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.480
.. I think that Bitcoin might be banned in China?
I think it's extremely unlikely that Bitcoin would

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.000
.. be banned in China. Just because every time
there's a little blip in the yuan and we see

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.080
.. $.5 - 1 billion flow into bitcoin doesn't mean that's
a large amount of money. For China, that's nothing.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.560
It's like you're facing the imminent collapse
of a giant hydro-electric dam; you're not going to

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.620
.. worry about that tiny, little trickle of water
in the side there. That's bitcoin. You're worrying

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.520
.. about the gushing outflows of the things
they are worried about. Right now they're passing

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.760
.. a new law to restrict mergers and acquisitions.
I heard this fantastic story of how Chinese companies

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.640
.. are exiting money from the economy even
though there are currency controls.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.040
It came about from a conversation with a
lawyer. This lawyer had been asked by

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.940
.. a Chinese company to participate in an
arbitration hearing. They said, "We want to do

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.680
.. this arbitration hearing. Would you be 
interested in participating and representing us?"

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.680
[The lawyer] said, "Yes, okay. Who is the
other party?" "Well, the other party doesn't exist

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.780
.. yet. We would like you to create the other
party, represent both us and the other party,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.340
and then we would like to lose an arbitration
award of about $5 million to the other party,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.700
which you will set up in another country."
[Laughter] When the need is great, it becomes

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.400
.. the mother of innovation. Legal innovation,
corruption innovation, et ceterea.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.380
They have much bigger problems.
Now, you will see bans in some countries.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.460
In the countries where they can arbitrarily
effect a ban, they can't actually affect that ban,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.400
in practice, on the ground. Because where
the rule of law is weak enough that a single

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.500
.. individual - without any recourse, due process,
or opposition - can simply ban a form of money,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.580
their ability to actually enforce that is probably
pretty weak too. Because everybody below them

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.980
.. is going to be taking bribes. Just imagine,
for example, the ruling comes down that says,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.040
"You can't do mining in China!" That goes
down to the districts, from the districts to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.020
.. the smaller districts, to the cities, to the
towns. Eventually, some official sends a fax

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.220
.. to the local village where they're running a
mining farm off [hydro-electricity] that represents

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.900
.. 40-50% of the municipal income of the entire area.
And they say, "You must close your mine."

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.280
What does the local official say?
"... We have no mines here!" [Laughter]

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.060
Or, "[whispers] Guys, close it down for 24 hours."
"[yells] We have eradicated mining in China!"

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.800
"Long live China and our great leader!"
"[whispers] Turn it back on." Right?

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.340
The ability to actually affect change on the
ground is mediated by layers and layers of

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.320
.. bureaucracy, which are more and more corrupt.
The bigger the crisis, the easier they are to corrupt.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.140
You've got to realise that these mines are quite
decentralised within China, and in many cases

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.560
.. they provide a stream of "corrupt money"
throughout every official in the area:

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.600
the police works for them, the mayor works for them,
the electricity company works for them...

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.440
Now the electricity companies are the ones
who are mining. Good luck shutting that down!

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.540
Again, it's not as easy to do. The higher the need, 
the more corruption &amp; invention you're going to have.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.220
[QUESTIONER:] What happens in the future
when Bitcoin becomes mainstream,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.720
governments or inter-governmental
organisations realise this, like the U.N., IMF,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.420
U.S., or E.U.? [What if they] decide to implement
their own cryptocurrencies, say "UScoin" or "IMFcoin"?

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:40.480
And they make it a rule that everyone has
to use that coin, and illegal to use any others?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.700
They set up their own nodes and put a lot
of budget in that. Could they cut out cryptocurrencies

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.160
.. in that way? [ANDREAS:] They going to turn a
lot of people into criminals, because a lot of people

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.580
.. will then ignore that rule and break that rule.
You have to worry... if your government is setting

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.840
.. up a system where they're not willing to
compete on an equal basis, on merits,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.480
but instead have to pass a law that forces 
you to use that system and makes it illegal to

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.700
.. use the competing system of open-market
economics, what the hell kind of government

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.140
.. did you just elect?! At that point, you're
beginning to wonder: what kind of government

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:28.940
.. is this? Let's go through the words:
Democracy? Eh, no. Republic democracy?

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:41.060
No. Constitutional democracy? Police state?
Fascism? Totalitarianism! That's the kind. Okay.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.180
That sounds like totalitarianism. I never
signed up for that. Great. If your government

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.780
.. starts doing crazy things... The question is:
can governments do crazy things that violate the

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:01.520
.. rights of billions of people? Sure they can!
They do it every day. We have to resist and make

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:09.180
.. choices, not only about which governments
we elect, but also sometimes make choices about

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.700
.. using other systems. People in Venezuela
are making that choice today, by breaking the law.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.280
Because the choice is between feeding their
family and not feeding their family!

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.920
At that point, whether you've broken the law is a
small issue, right? Again, I don't expect to see that.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.400
The reason I don't expect to see that is because
most governments in the world, when they see the idea

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.060
.. of people being able to use a free, electronic
commerce system that is efficient, creates

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.220
.. growth, opportunities, and jobs...  An innovation
that gives access to the world of commerce across

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.580
.. borders - What's not to like? That's something
you should encourage. If your government

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.260
.. does not encourage that, and does not believe
in those ideals (that people should be free

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:02.060
.. to associate, free to express, free to make choices), then your government is not free.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.960
Which is a much bigger problem than Bitcoin,
at that point. I would be less worried about their

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.080
.. power over cryptocurrencies than by the
fact that they have all the guns.
