00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
[AUDIENCE] My question's just around 
the next couple of weeks and months with Bitcoin.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.000
[ANDREAS]  Yes.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.040
[AUDIENCE]  Would you be able to just talk us
through, or provide some comments,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.240
in relation to the whole SegWit [debate]
and scaling issues with Bitcoin?

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.100
How you think that will play out over the next month
or two with a few of the key dates coming up?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.340
ANDREAS:  Well ... I wasn't prepared for that question.
[Laughter] I didn't think anybody was going to...

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.940
ask me that tonight. Or bring a UASF hat.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.940
Okay, first let me get a quick feel for the audience.
How many people have heard of forks or SegWit

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.040
in this audience? [Hands raise]

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.900
Okay, great. How many people
 understand what forks and SegWit are?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.000
About half of the previous group. All right.
Bitcoin, within its protocol,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.380
has this ability to fork, which means partition
- split in two. When you have coordination of

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.820
10,000 computers around the world,
if they disagree you need a way for them...

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.100
to temporarily disagree, come back together, and agree again. The blockchain does this. It's a fork function.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.460
It happens two or three times a week.
Nobody even notices it. The reason it happens is:

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.240
In order to keep all of these systems synchronised, if one side of the network goes out of sync for one block,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.480
by the next block they re-converge.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.000
There's a different kind of fork,
which is when the rules change,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.260
but only part of the network changes the rules.
Remember I was talking about these rules...

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.140
you have to validate? One of the fundamental
rules determines how big a block is.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.360
Today there is a rule in the system 
that says a block is one megabyte.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.420
That's it. Every ten minutes, one megabyte.
Six megabytes per hour, 144 megabytes per day.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.100
That's it for capacity. You have to fit
your transaction in that space.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.760
That causes some fee and capacity issues.
Some people want to change that rule,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.620
to about 2 megabytes, 4 megabytes,
8 megabytes, or whatever megabytes.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.200
In order to do that, they either have to
convince everyone or they split the network.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.700
They go off and do their own "Bitcoin," which has a different set of rules than the other Bitcoin...

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.800
that has the original set of rules.
That's called a contentious fork.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.660
There has been an ongoing scaling debate
for the last two years, which is about

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.280
how to make Bitcoin support more transactions.
The problem isn't that it's difficult to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.400
make Bitcoin support more transactions. The problem is
it's difficult to make Bitcoin support more transactions

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.580
without giving more power
to some participants than others.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.600
Keeping it free, open, decentralised,
while doing more transactions, is the hard question.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.380
The easy answer is, "Let's make it less free and open."
But a lot of people in Bitcoin don't like that answer,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.200
so they're not willing to do that.
That's the debate which has been going on.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.880
It's coming to a head on August 1st, 
in just about three weeks,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.060
with three competing proposals 
working at the same time.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.140
One is a proposal called Segregated Witness,
which restructures transactions in such a way...

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.740
that there are two parts to a transaction:
one which contains the signatures

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.200
and one which contains everything else.
Signatures are a big part of the transaction.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.880
This reorganisation increases the space [in blocks]
by about 1.7, so you get almost twice the amount

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.620
of space to do transactions. An alternative
proposal is to just increase the block size by two.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:06.180
And the third proposal is to do both, that's called SegWit2x. First do SegWit and then three months later,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.380
also increase the size of the block by 2 megabytes.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.820
Those are competing at the moment. The way this competition works is that everybody gets to choose...

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.820
what software they use. When you run a specific set of software, if you run your own Bitcoin software,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.200
if you choose a specific wallet or exchange,
the software you're running determines the outcome.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.500
Then, depending on how many people are running different sets of rules at the end of the day,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.200
there might be a change in the 
underlying rules if enough people agree.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.540
If this plays out as I expect, and many people expect,
we're going to have a fairly uneventful situation.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.100
85% of the network is going to change the rules on July 31st. On August 1st we're going to have a new network,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.720
which will have SegWit activated.
Everybody's money continues to run as it was before.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.580
All of the transactions continue to operate 
as they were before. There is a small possibility

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:15.420
that you have a small chain of the 10-20% who disagree.
They create a separate Bitcoin.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.180
Now, if that happens... 
Pay attention, because this is important.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:29.340
If you control your bitcoin, if you have a wallet that controls your bitcoin, not parked at an exchange...

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.460
If you put your money on an exchange,
you don't control it. The exchange does,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.700
and it matters what they will choose to do.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:45.980
But if you control it [in a non-custodial wallet], then after such a fork you now control "bitcoin" on both sides.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:54.000
So if you had one bitcoin before, now you have one bitcoin "alpha" and one bitcoin "beta." Right?

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.060
Then you can choose to keep both, sell one, or buy more of the other. Do whatever you want.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:09.460
So all you have to do, is do nothing for a few days before. A few days after, see how things play out.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.180
But you must control your own bitcoin.
If you do not control your own bitcoin,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:21.600
if you put your bitcoin on an exchange,
you are violating the most important rule of Bitcoin.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:32.040
Bitcoin is about individual participants controlling their
own systems, not trust somebody else with their money.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.160
We already have a system of institutions where you can trust someone else with your own money.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.680
It's called banking. Right? The problem is, in order to trust other people with your money,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.780
you have to have all of these organisations whose main purpose is to make sure...

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:55.260
that those people don't run away with your money, because they have a tendency to keep doing that.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.380
Pretty much any time in [human history] when someone has been trusted with other people's money,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.420
very quickly after that they've run away with the money.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.320
Banking is two systems: a system where other people hold your money and a whole other system where...

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.500
people watch them to make sure they don't run away with the money. Bitcoin isn't like that.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.800
You hold your own money. If you give your money to an exchange for them to hold for you,

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.840
here's the problem: there's no system watching them to make sure they don't run away.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.840
Guess what they're going to do?
[whispers] Run away with your money! [Laughter]
