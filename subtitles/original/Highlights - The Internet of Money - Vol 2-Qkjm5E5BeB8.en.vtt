00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.420
When I've discovered it

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.420
I spent four months

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.880
consuming as much as I could

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.700
except food.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.340
I lost 26 pounds

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.880
on the highly inadvisable diet

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.200
of obsession.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.900
These open, borderless, decentralized, censorship-resistant ...

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.560
And the reason it's so fascinating

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.940
is because it isn't what it appears to be at first glance ...

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.340
Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Venezuela, Argentina,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.100
Brazil, India, Turkey, Pakistan, the Ukraine -

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.700
what do these countries have in common?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Nice people.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.680
One day you wake up

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.160
and you discover that the banks are closed ...

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.420
Who benefits

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.200
in the end?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.180
The banks.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.400
They get bailed in ...

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.400
You'll be pleased to know

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.480
that that CEO, as we speak, is facing jail time.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.280
No.  Of course he isn't.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.580
Come on.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.400
Where have you been?

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.240
And before long, they will rewrite history.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.680
They will rewrite history to say that

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.000
the reason the banks are failing

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.940
and the reason the economy is on fire

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.800
is because you provided an exit,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.240
is because bitcoin exists.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.200
They will say that bitcoin started the fire.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.000
We didn't start the fire ...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.840
If money is speech,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.260
if money is a language,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.740
and you disconnect it from all other media

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.040
and you make it pure speech,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.520
pure content

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.760
- an internet content type, a protocol designation,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.940
money over IP,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.060
it completely separates it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.760
from all of these previous notions

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.240
of nations,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.260
sovereign issuers,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.500
institutions that control ...

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.200
Because bitcoin is not going after

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.560
replacing national currencies.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.120
Oh no.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.940
It's doing something

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.940
far more dangerous.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.260
It's encouraging people

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.220
to put their savings

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.080
outside the system ...

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.640
Bitcoin

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.500
introduces a platform

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.180
on which you can run currency as an application

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.020
on a network without any central points of control,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.040
a system completely decentralized like the internet itself.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.320
It is not money for the internet

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.280
but the internet of money ...

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.260
The internet of money was launched

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
on January 3rd 2009.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.140
Do not underestimate this ...
