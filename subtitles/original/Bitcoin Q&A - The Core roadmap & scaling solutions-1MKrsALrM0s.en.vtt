00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.560
A lot of the core team

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.720
They seem to be really...

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.160
"Gung Ho" on

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.240
going with the off-chain scaling solution

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.720
At least, prioritizing that first

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.340
So much so that I have quote here on reddit recently that says

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.780
We should not change Bitcoin to accommodate more users

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.980
And that's one of the things they were talking about in the IRC

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.280
So, uhh...

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.180
As a -

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.180
Instead we're going with Segwit soft forking, right?

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.260
Unless they going with the hard forking

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.880
They were also criticized

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.740
Notably by... other people

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.980
Like Jeff Garzik

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.280
of the risks that are inherent with going with a more complicated solution

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.840
Andreas: yes

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.460
So how do you compare this to say, Tom Xander's FlexCount proposal

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.220
of you know taking the hard fork approach and umm.. how like "core's roadmap" be wrong?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.300
Andreas: I mean this would take an hour to answer and...

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.560
More importantly I don't think my opinion matters - at all - to any of the parties involved, nor should it.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.460
Umm. This debate about big blocks and small blocks and how we scale bitcoin

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.280
First of all I don't think it's accurate to say that core is focused on "not scaling the core layer"

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.540
As you said it's a prioritization issue.Which one gets prioritized first?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:30.880
Now...I have uhh a nuanced opinion about this - which pisses off everybody.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.220
Because if you have a nuanced opinion then you are sitting on a fence and both sides can throw eggs at you

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.700
For not taking a side

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.340
And I'm not going to take a side

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.600
Because I think that both sides have merits

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.740
and really the question is about a matter of prioritization and sequencing and conservatism

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.060
versus a more aggressive approach to scaling

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.560
From time to time my opinion has changed

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.080
As I've seen new data

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.720
More recently, two days after the Ethereum fork

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.860
I thought "woah that went extremely well"

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.260
A clear 95% and 5% split

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.580
Technologically executed beautifully

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.940
"This is going to put a lot of pressure on core to come up with a similar solution for Bitcoin"

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.600
I was wrong.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.680
I was very wrong.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.460
Because a week later

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.660
Actually two weeks later

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.580
We discovered that even though technologically the fork worked

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.160
Politically it failed

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.580
and suddenly you ended up with a 70% and 30% split

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.520
and that was a disaster because there was not enough provision in the software to deal with replay attacks

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.440
it cost a lot of exchanges some money

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.340
I think there are some people from Coinbase in here that may have suffered some losses because of that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.900
because of the replay attacks

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.400
i know other exchanges did too

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.000
or i heard that other exchanges did

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.440
So

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.860
after that my opinion was revised

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.780
you know?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.860
and in Bitcoin (politically) I think a hard fork is incredibly difficult and will cause a deeper schism

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.140
So I don't think it's as easy as "one team is right the other is wrong"

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.060
I think we are going to have to let this roadmap play out

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.200
and for the time being

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.540
it seems that the majority of the participants in the system

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.760
Are continuing to put their trust in core

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.520
as long as core continues to deliver their roadmap

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.800
to a certain approximation

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.460
I'm not worried

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.700
because I think in the long term what we are going to do

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.940
is we are going to scale in a second layer

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.160
and we are going to scale the core layer with a blocksize increase

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.480
and we're going to do network optimzation

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.860
and and "ands"

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.780
the scaling options are not "either or" (mutually excusive)

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.700
they are "and and and"

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.880
and you just have to decide which comes first

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.720
I think a lot of this drama

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.900
is unnecessary

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.760
honestly in terms of segregated witness, soft fork versus hard fork

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.680
I think soft fork is a better way to go

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.220
I do. I think we are going to get cleaner and quicker than a hard fork.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.360
I think a hard fork given the current political situation of Bitcoin is way too dangerous - even if it was for something everyone agreed like SegWit

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.380
Which, I don't even think you'd get that agreement

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.500
So, that's probably a very nuanced answer

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.140
about a very large question

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.140
and I'm sorry if I didn't give you more of a direct answer

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.160
I don't think there is a simple black or white answer to that problem
