00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.480
[QUESTIONER] If that's the case, how is it possible that one single person, like you or me, is able to predict...

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.600
.. what is going to happen, when the whole thing is robust in consensus decision-making? Thank you.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.600
[ANDREAS] Yeah, that's a good question.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.800
The simple answer is that Bitcoin runs a certain set of rules and those rules can't be changed unless...

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.180
.. everybody agrees. By "agrees," that means you run the software that expresses the rules that you want.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.560
But if you don't do anything different, Bitcoin does not change. That's the whole point.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.820
The consensus rules remain the same.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.640
So, for example... I'm a U.S. citizen right now. We just had an announcement by the Federal Reserve that...

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.740
.. they're going to raise interest rates. This was at the last Friday meeting that they announced. They said...

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.760
"Maybe once more this year."

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.260
So I know what the interest rate will be next week. I don't know what the interest rate will be next year.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.900
I know what the "interest rate" will be for bitcoin in the year 2142, down to eight decimal points.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.060
Why? Because I can read the code. It's right there. That's one of the rules that's not going to change, because...

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.060
.. if you change that rule, it's not Bitcoin anymore. I can guarantee you: Bitcoin will never create 21 million coins.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.780
That's the upper limit. We will never reach it. We will get twenty million, nine hundred &amp; ninety-seven thousand...

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.880
.. and then it will stop. Why? Because that will never change. Because if you try to change that rule...

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.280
.. I will say "no." Most of the other people who are interested in Bitcoin will say "no."

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.680
If you split off the network, you can call your thing "Buttcoin," we'll keep calling our thing "Bitcoin," and...

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.760
.. we'll just keep the old rules.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.380
That certainty... It gives me a set of rules that are based on mathematics, [where] I can look into the future.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.340
I know exactly when - down to the block number - the distribution of bitcoins will reduce by half.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.160
In the year 2038. I can tell you which block number today, because it's mathematics.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.200
That's what gives us control. It's that this is not based on arbitrary decisions by people, it's based on mathematics.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.560
Now, some people don't like that. Some people want to have the ability to make political choices,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.560
.. to elect people who make choices for them, to change their mind, to have "flexibility" in the system.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.580
For that, Bitcoin isn't good, because Bitcoin is inflexible.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:42.060
If you want 24 million coins, sorry. We're not going to do that. It's going to be 20.997 [million], done.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.040
If you want certainty, if you want predictability, if you want hard mathematical rules, Bitcoin might be an...

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.900
.. interesting choice for you. If you don't, you can pick another digital currency or system of organisation.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.860
That's what we get. We get a level of certainty.
