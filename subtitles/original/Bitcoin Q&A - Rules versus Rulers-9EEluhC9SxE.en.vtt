00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
So, just a question from the community

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.800
Segwit vs Bitcoin Unlimited

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.740
What is your opinion on it?

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.300
Ok

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.060
So, This, this is the kind of a really really difficult question.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.080
But at the same time is fairly easy.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.180
I am in favor of activating SegWit.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.240
I am in favor of activating SegWit now.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.480
( Applauses )

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620
The reason for that, and don't applaud..

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.980
( Laughs  )

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.200
Form your own damn opinion

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.180
( Laughs )

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.100
I am no more the authority you should listen to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.160
than anyone else

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.560
This is not a system of belief where

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.960
I say: "FC Barcelona" and you go: "Yeeeaah!!"

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.920
Make up your own mind

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.400
I'll tell you why I think that's true

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.000
I think SegWit should be activated now because

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.040
it solves a number of different problems

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.100
Its the best tested solution that exists

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.520
I also think that..

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.900
I, I will make a disclosure,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.400
I used to..

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.920
think that big blocks would be better.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.300
About two years ago.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.380
And I ran..

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.860
Classic and XT to evaluate them

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.820
I ran Bitcoin Unlimited too

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.640
Not because I thought that we should hardfork to those

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.100
But to evaluate the software and understand how it works

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.840
And..If the choice was SegWit vs Classic

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.040
I might say: " You know a year from now

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.380
we could also do

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.100
a bump through Classic

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.640
The problem with Unlimited in my opinion

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.580
is that it doesn't change the rules

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.040
it changes, or sets the rulers

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.720
who then get to change the rules

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.200
And that is a VERY dangerous thing to do in Bitcoin

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.540
Specially if it is done as a contentious hardfork

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.460
I think Bitcoin Unlimited is a completely untested

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.140
system of consensus

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.840
If somebody wants to test that with 51%

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.220
it is going to be an interesting experiment

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.560
Bitcoin is going to get attacked eventually

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.640
maybe is better if it gets attacked sooner

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.160
rather than later

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.660
If you hold Bitcoin as an investment

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.420
this would be painful

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.500
So, hardforking Bitcoin

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.320
with a low percentage and without

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.360
Very broad consensus

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.020
would damage Bitcoin

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.700
We will end up with two chains that will survive

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.620
And the sum of their value will be far less

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.420
than the sum of value we have in Bitcoin today.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.680
I think that's a very bad idea

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.920
Not my choice!

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.600
However,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.720
Here is something I can tell you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.500
Bitcoin as a currency; as a means of exchange

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.300
The way I use it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.900
for getting paid for my job

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.320
works at two hundred dollars

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.880
At two thousand dollars

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.680
and at twenty dollars

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.560
It doesn't change, for me.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.960
Bitcoin as a stable store of value however,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.840
doesn't work with a hardfork

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.680
So, it really depends on what you use it for

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.260
And there is probably a broader discussion to be had there.
