00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
[Q] My youngest brother, he is a professor in law.
He teaches his students to read the word of the law,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.100
write the word of the law, but judge according
to the spirit of the law. When we look at these...

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.600
.. new technologies, like distributed ledgers
and Ethereum smart contracts, suddenly we're [faced]

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.040
with the dilemma where you have to decide
who is judging the spirit of a piece of code.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:36.100
So if you look at it from that perspective... 
maybe national, maybe regional, maybe global...

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.060
Is a legal framework necessary, preemptively?
If so, how urgent is that?

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:54.420
[A] As a system that overrides the consensus
algorithm? No. Not only is it not necessary,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.700
it is odious, it is contrary to the very concept
we're trying to build. We already have plenty...

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.800
.. of institutions that allow you the flexibility
to try and see if your problem will be adjudicated...

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.420
.. based on the spirit of law, in front of an
impartial judge or jury of your peers.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.920
We already have all of that. Everything we have
is all of that. Your [brother's] students will...

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.720
.. leave law school believing in the spirit of law and
be gradually ground down through the system of...

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.440
.. prosecution and courts until eventually they
don't believe in anything -- other than winning the case.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.660
That's usually what happens. The reason
we have a consensus algorithm is because...

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.820
.. we're trying to build an alternative system
where the outcome is known based on the...

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.840
.. formulation of a contract, and it is completely
neutral and impartial. Will that always work?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.280
Hell no, it won't! Sometimes it will backfire badly, 
and we will have a DAO-saster. [LAUGHTER]

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.020
But then the question is: how can law create
a safety net? The worst case you can have,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.800
if you have a system where the smart contract
has failed, is that every participant in the smart...

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:28.320
.. contract finds anyone they can specifically
identify (jurisdictionally, geographically, individually)

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.660
sue them in whichever court they choose,
or find themselves at the time. Then you have...

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.920
.. to deal with this morass. I'm not suggesting
that's a good outcome, I'm suggesting that...

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.240
.. it's an inevitable outcome. If you have disputes
that arise in this system and you don't have the...

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.740
.. means of resolving them other than a consensus
mechanism, people will start firing lawsuits...

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.020
.. at each other. There's this really interesting framework
called the New York Convention On Arbitration,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:08.260
which is an international treaty that allows you
-- in 156 countries -- to claim independence,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.820
legal arbitration, through a private system of
law that you can pre-define: the duration, discovery,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.780
who the judges are going to be, how it's going
to be adjudicated, etc. Perhaps we should be...

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.580
.. building systems that say, 'If there is a failure
in this consensus system, we agree to waive our...

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.200
.. rights under the New York Convention to
local courts, and instead subject ourselves...

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:40.920
.. arbitration under a crowd-jury, selected by smart
contract 0XABCDEF, to provide the final solution.'

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.200
Maybe you do that. I don't know if it's a good
solution; I know it's better than trying to defend...

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.700
.. yourself in a hundred local courts.
[Q] What if it's not the consensus algorithm,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.540
but in the use, or rather abuse, of the system?
For example, TheDAO... but I can imagine much worse.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.160
[A] The trick is distinguishing between what is
'use' and what is 'abuse' of the system.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.860
In a system that has no spirit of law, but
only has rule of consensus, there is no such...

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.280
.. thing as a distinction between 'use' and 
'abuse' of the system. If you can use the system,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.780
it is 'use' of the system. If the consensus algorithm
allowed it, it is 'use.' The distinction you're putting,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:33.420
which is a normative judgement of the spirit,
doesn't apply. It simply doesn't. Quite honestly,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.920
I think TheDAO was a great lesson in that.
The lesson wasn't "should we fork or...

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.620
.. should we not fork?" The leson is: don't put
$150 million in an untested contract, you idiots!

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.340
[LAUGHTER] But that is a lesson that is
self-correcting. People got hurt by that.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.960
They're going to learn, and we're going to
get better. We have to realise that what...

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.980
.. we're building here, these systems...
Their defining characteristic is caveat emptor:

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.120
they are free market systems. They are free,
collaborative, voluntary participation systems.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.120
Caveat emptor - buyer beware. 
That is not a warning, that is a fact.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.780
You take it as it is. If you don't like it, you
can use the other systems. We have plenty...

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.300
.. of them. But we're not going to change
this one and make it into one of the others.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.400
In fact, we're going to fiercely resist that change.
