00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.840
What do you mean when you say a transaction

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.640
is "incorrect"? What is the difference between "correct"

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.640
and "incorrect"?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.240
That's a great question.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.780
There are a set of rules within the system,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.040
probably about thirty or forty rules altogether,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.140
that the software analyses.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.540
For example, if a transaction says my address is paying

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.980
your address some amount, well...

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.700
1. A correct transaction is one where

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.500
my address is correctly formatted as a valid address;

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.220
your address is correctly formatted as a valid address.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.940
2. The amount described is within 0-21 million bitcoin,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.080
which is the maximum amount you can have.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.100
I [must] actually have that amount to pay you;

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.400
if I don't have it, I can't pay it.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.720
3. That amount hasn't been spent before from

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.620
my account, so it's not being "double-spent."

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.180
4. The transaction has sufficient fee to pay the network.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.160
There is all of these little rules, not just for transactions

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.880
but also for the blocks that contain them.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.540
They're cumulative.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.620
My signature has to be correctly formatted.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.760
Those are the logical, "human-level" rules.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.240
There is thirty or so rules that are very [much] at the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.360
programming level: the first three bits of the version

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.360
number of the transaction have to be 'x,'

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.840
unless the timelock on the transaction is set,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.500
in which case these version bits...

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.620
You know, all of these arcane rules, which have to do

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.200
with analysing the format of the transaction.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.980
But your software does that, so you don't need to worry

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.540
about it. You just say, "I have money, I give you money..."

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.860
Click, click, boom, done.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.620
Your software will produce a valid transaction.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.120
The important thing to check is...

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.300
The software is not [asking], "Are you a good person?"

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.500
"Are you a bad person? Are you on a list of good people..

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.980
.. or bad people?" "Are you allowed?"

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.440
"When were you born?" "What is your gender?"

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.920
"What is your religion?" None of those are in the rules.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.960
That's the important distinction.
