00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
I feel like Bitcoin has some pretty interesting

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.178
Philosophies about democracies that are baked into the consensus level and so I'm curious to hear your thoughts on

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.759
I guess democracy and then the intersection between blockchain and democracy, and then democracy on a blockchain

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.090
Yeah, I mean democracy is a loaded word, and democracy is a loaded word because for most people

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.369
we project onto Democracy what we think

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.059
we want or believe democracy to be

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.699
I'm Greek we invented it

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.750
When we invented it under some very specific circumstances?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.079
three thousands land owning slave owning white males got to decide for themselves and

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.198
the one hundred and fifty thousand slaves women and children who they owned as property

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.190
That's Democracy

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.079
I don't believe in Democracy

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.820
Democracy is

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.150
51% of the population having the ability to decide to kill the other 49 because they're inconvenient

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.760
homosexual

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.260
Jewish

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.180
Whatever, right?

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.380
Democracy without

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.600
restraints without Human rights without Civil rights without constitutional

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.839
protections is a brutal system of oppression where once you get that sliver of

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.049
majority you can eradicate everybody else

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.189
Strictly speaking that's what democracy is. Now, most people have

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.950
constitutional republic and democracies

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.669
Parliamentary democracies, and other means of sweetening that system a bit to ensure the minorities don't get oppressed

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.320
How well does it work? I don't know bitcoin isn't a democracy

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.619
Not even in the mining

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.990
Bitcoin is a system of

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.299
Super majority Consensus

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.718
when it takes a very large percentage of the

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.468
deciding groups the five constituencies of consensus in order to make change, which makes change very difficult

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.969
bitcoin is a system that

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.969
decentralizes power radically

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.999
Politically many people call that cyberpunk, crypto-anarchy other words we don't get half

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.540
Bitcoin is redefining

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.110
political and organizational

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.940
systems not just bitcoin open public blog change this technology born out of the internet and expressing

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.610
some of the radically egalitarian

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.030
open Philosophies a free flow of information

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.080
freedom of speech freedom of Association on the transnational

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.270
basis that transcends not just borders, but every aspect of identity

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.240
without identity

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.190
That's a radical new political system. It started with the internet. It's now happening to money, and we don't get half good words for it

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.140
So some people might call it democracy. I don't think that's what it is

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.199
Democracy mostly in developed worlds today is a system of hierarchical and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.839
Institutional organizational principles that was born out of the era of industrialization in the 18th and 19th

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.140
Century it does not scale anymore

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.519
It doesn't serve a planet of seven and a half billion people where we have enough food to feed everyone

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.550
And we just can't distribute it

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.790
Where we have the ability to produce energy

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.880
for everyone, and we just can't distribute it. Where we can solve problems like climate change

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So hierarchical systems are failing

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.939
flat, network based, collaborative

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.569
decentralized ad-hocracies, on the internet

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.399
may be the new thing. who knows? It will be fun find out

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.180
So I'm along for the ride

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.000
Q: To follow on essentially from what you are saying,  you talked about

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.479
the different constituencies within the ecosystem and about the fact that the consensus on

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.209
forks is formed by groups

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.140
So it might sound like to sort of chaotic

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.000
consensus algorithm

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.190
Whereas I wonder I mean is it really distribution? Or are there

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.849
coalition's that are able to force a consensus. What is the structure of a consensus if you look at within

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.089
at the level of those two consistencies

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.519
It actually gets broader than that because you look at take more fine-grained view of the system

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.820
it's more players, but take a look a level of those constituencies

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.360
And what's the structure of a consensus formation at that level, do you think?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.420
We don't know yet

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.260
We're finding out and here's the interesting thing

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
You've got layers of this, right?

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.319
so there's a political layer which has to do with

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.760
public statements, unraveling the troops and signing agreements and

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.640
Negotiating with others who you think are in power or may have enough power to sway others and using

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.870
influences and

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.149
Persuaders and pundits. right? I don't play that game that some do in trying to create these Coalition's

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.839
You know, pick your venn diagram across these five constituencies and say here it is

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.830
This is the new big blocker constituency. This is the small blocker constituency. This is the "we haven't given it a name yet"

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.249
constituency. All of that noise

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.080
doesn't change the bitcoin consensus rules at the end of the day

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.050
It's going to play out

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.260
under Network protocol with nodes that are participating

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.140
that express the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.019
economic interests of their users

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:55.879
Through choices about which set of consensus rules they use, on their live systems and with their transactions

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.719
So money, on the system

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.510
choices of the Software you use

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.968
Choices of the software you mine with, if you're a miner. All of those things in the undetermined

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.219
And it's not going to be sometimes a clear-cut

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.039
determination it may involve a prolonged tug-of-war. It may involve a realignment of

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.868
Incentives, my prediction is that talk is cheap in a lot of this

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.349
People will say anything

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:26.839
At that last moment

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:31.308
When push comes to shove and you see that the consensus rules are moving one way

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.199
you know you stick your finger in the air, and you detect which way the wind is blowing and

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:43.159
suddenly your very sacred principled opinions. Go straight out the window, and you follow your pocket

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.559
Because you can be right and you can be wrong

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:54.018
but if you break the consensus rules, you are poor either way and

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:56.669
that

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:57.869
overriding

00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:02.239
economic, practical, right now, game theory that plays out on the network

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:04.939
overrides everything else

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:10.518
people may say one thing and run different software, they may signal they want one thing and then

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.759
execute something else. They may hold on

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:20.809
until they start losing a lot of money and then change their minds, and we don't know how this is going to play out

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:29.299
We're going to find out hopefully in a not too disruptive way. We may end up with two camps taking their own path

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:35.029
That's what it ethereum did. I don't like that particular solution for bitcoin, but some others do
