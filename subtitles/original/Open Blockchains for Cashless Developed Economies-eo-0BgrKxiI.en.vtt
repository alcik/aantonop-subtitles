00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:07.600
Coming here is a great pleasure and great honor! This is my first time in Scandinavia.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:16.000
I've travelled to 44 countries so far, but [this is] the first visit to Scandinavia. Certainly hoping it won't be my last.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:26.120
But it's also been a bit challenging for me to think about what exactly I would talk about in the context of...

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:34.120
.. this conference. Now, the conference is "Oslo Blockchain Day." Those of you who know me probably...

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.800
.. know that I'm interested in the open public blockchains: the ones that are disruptive, the ones...

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.040
... that are global, free, and censorship-resistant. Things like Bitcoin, like Ethereum. I'm interested in those...

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:59.500
.. because they provide remedies for some big societal problems. Problems such as corrupt governance.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:08.800
Problems such as failing democratic institutions. Problems such as large populations of unbanked people,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.600
corrupt banks and banking practices. Difficulties in finance and international finance.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:26.740
Problems - in short - that Norway doesn't have. [laughter] So that's a bit of a challenge. If I go to Argentina and...

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.160
I say, "You know... it's probably not a good idea to have your government in charge of money," they say:

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.500
"Well... obviously!" Obviously. Thirty-five years ago, they were throwing people out of aircraft for disagreeing...

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.740
.. with them. Not exactly the kind of government you want to give power over the banking system.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.860
Currency controls, hyperinflation... you can't have that conversation with a Norwegian.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.900
If I go to a Norwegian and say, "I really don't think government should be in charge of money,"

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.580
the average Norwegian would say, "Why not? They're doing a very good job."

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.340
"I'm very pleased with my government."

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:17.100
It's true, right? This is a bit of a challenge, to explain why these technologies matter in one of the few places...

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:27.220
.. in the world where government mostly works in a very good way. It's not tyrannical, it's not oppressive.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:37.220
Quite the opposite, quite the opposite... In fact two days ago, I was walking around the city &amp; I noticed a whole...

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:48.400
.. lot of people wearing turbans. Many of them didn't look like Sikhs, but they were wearing turbans anyway.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:58.840
I asked, "What is this?" "Oh, it's Turban Day today!" On Turban Day, in order to show solidarity with immigrant...

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.540
.. populations, especially Sikhs, we all wear colorful turbans and we have a competition for who has...

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.620
.. the best turban, which then gets displayed. Like... oh my god!

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:22.500
In the United States, we're building a wall to keep out the wave of refugees who are coming from countries...

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.840
.. that we recently bombed. Kind of the same thing? [laughter]

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:39.320
It's a bit of a strange situation, trying to explain why you would need such a thing. Norwegians have very...

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:47.860
.. effective banking. Efficient, convenient. This is one of the most cashless societies in the world.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.280
Actually, it's the second most cashless country in the world. Do you know who the first cashless country...

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.960
.. in the world is? Anyone? [AUDIENCE]: Sweden? [ANDREAS]: Kenya. Whoa, you didn't expect that one!

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:13.640
Kenya. Because of M-Pesa, a system of digital money that's transmitted using SMS. But Norway is #2.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.920
Almost there. You can catch up soon. This is a country in which cash is almost invisible.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.660
I haven't used cash at all since I've been here. Credit cards, debit cards, very convenient. You also have...

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:38.080
.. mobile payment systems. You can use this system called Vipps, I believe? Very easily you can send money...

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.460
.. to anyone, up to about five thousand kroner. You can send more to some organisations. You have to pay...

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.560
.. a fee if you want that. But under five thousand is basically free and fast, instantaneous almost.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.600
Do you use checks in this country? When is the last time you saw a check? Let's see who's over fifty [years old].

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:11.460
[Has] anybody seen a check here? No? You've seen checks? Very good. Could you explain a check to...

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.080
.. a fifteen-year old Norwegian? They'd think you're an alien, right? It would be a bit like trying to explain...

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:25.500
.. a fax machine. This is the challenge: explaining this technology. Well, the rest of the world isn't like Norway.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:36.720
It simply isn't. In hundreds of countries, more than a hundred, government is not benevolent, functioning,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:50.800
and incorrupt. Banks are rapacious predators, not partners in business. Control of money by institutions...

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.940
.. leads to power concentration and corruption. But I'm not going to try and sell you these technologies on that...

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.840
.. basis. I'm not trying to sell these technologies. What I'm trying to understand is, what is the perspective...

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.800
.. from which a country like Norway can benefit from a technology such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:24.120
What is a blockchain's purpose in this country? The real idea here is an issue of functionality to me.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:37.780
If you look at what you can do with Vipps, for example, and you look at what you can do with Bitcoin, it seems...

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:46.920
.. like Bitcoin is just a weird, geeky version of Vipps that's difficult to explain - but other than that doesn't seem to...

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:54.300
.. have any benefit. The fees are higher on Bitcoin too. How many of you here have done at least one transaction...

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:02.140
.. using an open cryptocurrency? Bitcoin, Ethereum, or anything else? Pretty much everyone? At least 80%.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:13.400
So why would you use this technology here? I'd like to take a moment to think back about the early days...

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:21.260
.. of the internet, and give you a comparison of a time which may give you some insight. In the 1990s,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:30.680
I was trying to introduce a new technology to financial services companies in London. At the time,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:38.520
I came with this new technology as a young consultant and I told them, "This is called the internet."

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:45.260
"We have a system called 'electronic mail.' You can use it to communicate with other financial services...

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:55.620
.. companies." It was very difficult, because they said, "But we already have faxes, we already have telexes."

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:07.380
If you make the comparison, email at the time wasn't working so well. [With] fax, you could send text,

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:14.520
but you could also send a drawing, you could send a diagram, you could send a chart. You could hand-write...

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:21.040
.. a note and fax it. You couldn't do any of those things with email. Attachments were not working very well,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:27.220
capacity wasn't there. If you tried to attach an image, we didn't have scanners and cameras, things like that...

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:34.360
.. [which] made it easy. You couldn't really do that. Email didn't have guaranteed delivery for text.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:44.840
But every single institution that I had working with me had telex, and telex had guaranteed delivery with proof...

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:52.000
.. that you could take to a court, so they used it for the settlement of securities instruments, because they...

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.120
.. could prove that a telex had been received. So how do you tell people this [internet] is going to be better,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:11.700
when at the time it's not better? If you looked at the internet then, what you see is only a glimpse of what...

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:18.540
.. is yet to come. What you see is a protocol that can kind of do what already exists, but not very well.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:26.600
But it's much more flexible, and in the future can do a lot more. If you look at Bitcoin versus Vipps today,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.620
it looks like Vipps is a lot easier, right? But Bitcoin is a lot more flexible, Bitcoin is programmable,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:43.040
"Bitcoin" isn't owned by anyone. If you try to think about where that will take us in the future, imagine the entire...

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:52.600
.. world had Vipps; imagine if you could Vipps money to 7.5 billion people anywhere on the planet, just as easily...

00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:04.380
.. as you can someone in Norway. Eventually, a technology like Bitcoin will be able to do that. Not yet.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:11.140
There aren't enough people using it. It's not as easy to use. There isn't the capacity to do it for...

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:19.320
.. 7.5 billion people, just like there wasn't the capacity to do image attachments on email. But if you try to...

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:29.200
.. imagine where this is going as the flexibility increases, things become easier and easier. There's this very...

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:36.860
.. strange thing that happens with new and disruptive technologies - which is that at first, they completely fail...

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:44.220
.. to even simulate the technology they're replacing. Think about the introduction of the first car.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:51.400
You have a horse, you have a carriage, and someone tries to sell you a car. They're there demonstrating this...

00:10:51.400 --> 00:11:04.160
.. vehicle. Compared to the horse you have, the car sucks in every way. First of all, horses are the original...

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:12.280
.. self-driving vehicle: full autonomy. In cars we would call that "level four autonomy." [laughter]

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:21.720
You know, when the guy walks out of the saloon, [whistles], and a horse comes? We just managed...

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:28.300
.. to do that with a Tesla in the last three years, where it comes from the parking lot and picks you up.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:38.300
Horses could do that for thousands of years, right? You arrive outside of the bar at the saloon, jump off...

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:44.860
.. the horse, and the horse just goes by itself to go refill on water and fuel.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:58.380
It has independent, four-leg drive with traction control, autonomous obstacle avoidance, distance keeping...

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:07.120
.. and lane management. Meanwhile, if you try to use a car in the roads they had then, it would get stuck.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:16.400
It wouldn't be able to move, because the roads were not viable. This happens again and again with technology,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:27.080
not just in the past but also in the near present. 3D printing - most people hear about 3D printing, they read...

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.120
.. about it, and it got really popular in the last few years, with a small company called MakerBot.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:38.740
How many people have heard of MakerBot and 3D printing? Yes. Have you seen it? 3D printing was not...

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:45.740
.. invented by MakerBot, of course. You could buy 3D printers at the time when MakerBot was released.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:56.740
They were the size of four refrigerators stacked next to each other. They used either laser sintering or other...

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:06.020
.. forms of metal deposition. They cost about $300,00 to about $1 million dollars. They produce beautiful,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:15.600
beautiful prototypes that can be used directly even in engines, out of metal components. They have a...

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:26.180
.. MakerBot in the corner that stinks of plastic, is rickety, very low resolution, and it produces this gnarly little...

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:35.700
.. plastic cube. And you say, "Behold the revolution of 3D printing!" It shipped. Anyone in the 3D printing...

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:43.280
.. business would say, "That's ridiculous. Why are you even pretending to try to compete?"

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:53.900
The answer is simple: because that thing cost $1. It looks crap now, but give it 30 years, put it on every...

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.700
.. desktop, and see it change the world, because you're never going to change it with this $1 million piece of...

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:07.860
.. equipment that you built - that's the size of a bus. We have drones. Everybody excited about drones?

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:18.580
Who has played with a drone? Fascinating, right? Imagine a platform that can be released from your...

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:29.000
.. hand, guided to an altitude, provide remote surveillance, perhaps monitor your location to tell you...

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.980
.. if someone is approaching (like a guard duty), return automatically, and land back on your hand whenever...

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:48.420
.. you wanted. Arabs had this technology 6,000 years ago, they called it birds of prey. They taught a hawk...

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:59.160
.. how to do that: take off from the hand, do wide-area surveillance, come back. Faster than a drone,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:09.840
higher than a drone, feeds itself. [It] can actually go hunting for you too. Doesn't get lost, doesn't crash,

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:19.480
doesn't have twenty minutes of endurance -- [but] twenty hours of endurance on a single meal. A drone looks...

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:31.920
.. terrible compared to a bird of prey. Yet can you make a swarm of a thousand that can move at 500 miles/ hour?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:37.940
You can never do that with a bird of prey. Give us ten years with drones and watch what happens!

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:47.460
This is what happens with technology again and again. In the first iteration, what it does isn't improve on...

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:57.020
.. the existing capabilities. Instead, it widens the field. It opens up the door for a much wider set of applications...

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:08.180
.. that were never possible before. In doing so, it fails to excel at applications you can already do - momentarily.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:16.840
Until economies of scale, volume, coordination, and productivity make it much better at everything else...

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:24.720
.. and the thing that it originally failed at. We see this happen again and again with technology.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:32.940
Now we're going to see it with the technology of money. Vipps is great - as long as you're over 15 [years old],

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:39.560
have a debit card or bank accounts denominated in Norway, and only want to send money to Norwegians.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:48.980
Bitcoin looks like it can't do any of those things, but all you need to qualify is the ability to download...

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:56.860
.. an application on an Android phone that can cost $25, anywhere in the world. You can then send money to...

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:05.820
.. 7.5 billion people with that same application, as long as they download it too. At first, it looks inferior,

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:15.260
but it opens the door to create a completely unified financial system without borders. But it's not just...

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:24.340
.. a payments network. One of the other things that this technology does is provide a global store of value,

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:35.860
a universal reserve currency, a system of digital gold. We will look back (I think) ten years from now, if this...

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:45.660
.. experiment is successful, and see the emergence of this global standard, this new asset, that allows both...

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:54.200
.. individuals to preserve [their] wealth, and eventually even states to preserve wealth. It sounds preposterous,

00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:03.840
if I say it today. But one day, countries will accumulate cryptocurrencies as part of their foreign reserves,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:14.380
as part of their capital reserves. It seems ridiculous [but] it will happen. It will happen and they will be able to...

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:23.260
.. acquire these cryptocurrencies - that will not only represent value, but will also represent neutrality.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:32.060
They will not belong to any flag, they will not reflect any geopolitics. Every form of reserve currency we have...

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:43.440
.. today reflects geopolitics, reflects national interests. But cryptocurrencies are reflective of math,

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:50.960
not geopolitical interests. You can have this emergence of a global asset class, a stable store of value,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:19:06.800
that provides us with independence. And that's just the beginning. There are other blockchains, they're doing...

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:17.600
.. different things, things more in the area of governance. How many here have heard of / used Ethereum?

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:27.340
Now you keep hearing these words "smart contract." Most people have no idea what a smart contract is.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:36.380
It sounds 'smart,' it sounds like a 'contract,' so maybe it will be related to legal language. But really, that term...

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:43.320
.. is quite misleading. A "smart contract" is really a dumb program. It's a very simple, dumb program.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:53.040
What's special isn't the program [or] the smart contract. What's special is the platform it's running on,

00:19:53.040 --> 00:20:03.680
a platform that allows you to execute code in a persistent, consistent, worldwide, secure, neutral,

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:11.840
censorship-resistant way. Unstoppable code that runs everywhere, that runs the same everywhere. A platform...

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:21.180
.. that can be trusted to combine financial activity and governance in a single program. That's a really exciting...

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:30.560
.. opportunity. Now, what are we using this opportunity for? To do initial coin offerings? That's a waste of that...

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:37.600
.. fantastic opportunity, and it's going to create some spectacular explosions when these ICOs go 'boom'!

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:49.720
But that doesn't change the fact that behind this is the possibility to reinvent governance. If you understand...

00:20:49.720 --> 00:21:01.680
.. what Bitcoin is doing, Bitcoin is a direct disruption to the basis of central banking, store of value,

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:12.200
payment networks,  and international wire transfers. Those are obvious. Bitcoin offers solutions that disrupt...

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:20.280
.. these four functions: central banking, store of value, payment networks, international wires. It offers a novel...

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:29.220
.. way of doing these things in a way that's open, global, neutral, censorship-resistant. That's exciting.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:36.260
What exactly is Ethereum doing? What does that disrupt? For that, you have to look at one of the most...

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:47.300

.. a 19th century invention, it's actually a 16th century invention. In the 19th century, we see the modern...

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:07.700
.. version of that, which is available across the world. It goes back to the East India Company.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:15.220
The Dutch East India Company and British East India Company, the first two corporations, that under a royal...

.. charter allowed individuals to invest in a journey across the seas in order to get spices and bring them...

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:32.380
.. to Europe. That institution is the basis of commerce, and has been the basis of commerce for 400 years.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:43.740
It's about to get majorly disrupted. What are the key characteristics of a corporation? 1. Jurisdiction.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:57.560
Corporations have a domicile, they have a location. They have a specific country of registration. Who needs that?

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:06.220
Forget jurisdiction. How about we do that on completely global basis, with companies not registered anywhere,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:15.080
but are registered everywhere? Or really not registered, they simply exist. The decentralized autonomous...

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:24.520
.. organisation is the reinvention of a 500-year old concept, of a corporation for the modern age.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:32.780
It allows any number of humans or software agents to collaborate on the long-term or short-term basis,

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:39.940
to engage in a common venture with a governance structure that allows them to vote, a system that...

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:47.900
.. allows them to share in equity, contribute to funding, and receive returns on investments.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:57.760
Most of the early examples we have so far are focused on the funding side, which in my opinion is the wrong...

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:06.940
.. side of the equation. Funding before governance is a very dangerous example. Most of the initial coin...

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:13.220
.. offerings we see coming out to Ethereum have a lot of funding and very little governance. The modern...

.. corporation is going to be reinvented as we introduce systems that offer us modern, new, novel mechanisms...

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:31.440
.. for governance. Eventually they'll reinvent financing as well, but governance is where it starts. I use a simple

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:45.900
... analogy to explain this concept: what is the difference between a rocket and a bomb? Rocket science is really...

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:52.860
.. the fundamental difference. It comes down to governance. If you look at a rocket, chemically speaking,

00:24:52.860 --> 00:25:00.020
it's a bomb. The components of a rocket are exactly the same chemical components you would use to...

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:08.960
.. construct a bomb. The only difference is one is an exothermic, violet reaction, that happens almost...

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:16.260
.. instantaneously and in every direction. The other one is an exothermic, violent reaction that happens...

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:26.600
.. gradually over time, in one direction. Sometimes, if you get the governance wrong, the rocket turns into a bomb.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:38.000
It goes from one direction - measured - to every direction instantaneously. How you learn how to do governance,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:46.300
is by building several of these, having most of them blow up before they leave the launch pad, learning how to...

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:55.880
.. do better governance - until one day, you can get quite high with these devices. You can achieve rocket science.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:02.300
But if you look at the early days of rocket science, it doesn't seem possible. These things [kept] exploding.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:10.880
Ethereum's ICOs are rocket science without governance, and what we're creating is a lot of pretty powerful...

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:16.420
.. bombs that are exploding on the launch pad. More of them are going to blow up. Some of them are going to...

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:23.360
.. reach a few hundred feet in altitude and then blow up spectacularly. Part of the reason is: we're putting a lot...

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:29.920
.. of fuel (which is the money) behind very little governance. The more fuel you put, and the less...

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:35.880
.. governance you have, the more likely you are to make the transition from rocket to bomb. The worst thing...

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:44.160
.. you can do to a startup is take a group of professionals who have never worked together and...

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:52.760
.. then hand them $10-15 million dollars on the basis of an idea. Watch how quickly friendships fall apart,

00:26:52.760 --> 00:27:01.720
how quickly the people you thought were your friends give you a call from Bermuda saying, "I'm really sorry..."

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:12.320
"man, but it was too tempting. I had to take the money and run." This is going to keep happening, but don't let...

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:20.780
.. that distract from the very fundamental thing that's happening underneath. We are gradually building...

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:31.500
.. reusable, mature governance models. Governance models that will reinvent the modern corporation.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:38.540
This is no small task. Reinventing the modern corporation will radically transform international...

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:48.280
.. commerce. These two examples are just what happened in the first eight years of this technology...

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:56.660
.. called the blockchain. Out of this technology, we have these two examples: 1) a system of money, payments,

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:02.820
international currency, and possibly a reserve currency 2) a system of governance through smart contracts,

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:13.660
that will revolutionize the modern corporation. Don't let that distract you though, there's a lot more "blockchain"...

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:25.700
.. going on, and most of it is bullshit. The very difficult task is being able to tell the difference between these...

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:35.100
.. very real, meaningful, disruptive, innovative technologies that we see, and the meaningless,

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:44.000
marketing-driven, funding-oriented excuses that people call "blockchain" in order to raise money.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:54.100
It's often very difficult to tell which is which. You have to start with: what are the principles a blockchain delivers?

00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:04.500
I prefer to speak of open public blockchains, because "open public blockchain" is the magic technology.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:16.420
It's like the difference between internet and TCP/IP. TCP/IP is not revolutionary, TCP/IP is not what made...

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:25.020
.. the internet magical. In fact, the early internet didn't use TCP/IP and it was still revolutionary.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:33.400
Today's internet could change to a different protocol and still be revolutionary. What's magical about the internet...

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:44.200
.. is that it is open, borderless, neutral, and censorship-resistant. It is a global, equalizing communication...

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:52.720
.. system, and TCP/IP is just a means by which it gets that done. The open public blockchains today are...

00:29:52.720 --> 00:30:04.600
.. the internet of money, the internet of corporations, that we see now emerging. "Blockchain" is just the TCP/IP.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:12.100
You can take TCP/IP and make something very boring. How many of you work in corporate environments?

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:20.880
My condolences. How many of you have an intranet in your company? How many of you love the applications...

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:31.300
.. you have on your intranet? TCP/IP, right? You take this technology, and what you do is remove all the things...

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:39.420
.. that make the internet interesting. The internet is open, an intranet is closed. The internet is borderless,

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:45.920
an intranet has firewalls. The internet has permissionless applications anyone can write,

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:53.260
the intranet is controlled by the IT department and has applications from Oracle and Microsoft.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:59.780
The internet connects you to the world, the intranet isolates you from the world.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:08.180
So you've taken the same technology, changed the culture, and built something that doesn't resemble...

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:16.680
.. what you started with. You end up with something that is insecure, stale, boring, and that sucks productivity...

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:26.560
.. instead of increasing it. The very same companies that luxuriated intranets - banks, large corporations -

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:34.180
.. are now luxuriating in "blockchain," because they failed to learn the fundamental lesson. What is magical in...

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:42.100
.. these technologies is the open, permissionless, interconnected, borderless nature. Connecting the world,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:50.460
freeing the flow of information. In the case of Bitcoin, freeing the flow of money globally. In the case of...

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:58.100
.. Ethereum, freeing the constraints of governance and corporations globally. You take that technology...

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:08.160
.. you close it, control it, control access, control innovation, and build a system that is inside your...

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:18.780
.. company. What you've built is the intranet of money, the intranet of corporations. It is boring. But it's worse...

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:27.780
.. than that. It's not just boring, it's also insecure. It is almost impossible to secure the system because...

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:35.220
.. you centralise control over it. The only reason Bitcoin is secure, the only reason Ethereum is secure, the only...

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:41.400
.. reason all of these open public blockchains are secure, is because control is completely decentralised.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:50.440
Centralising control does not make things more secure, it makes them vulnerable. You've also taken away...

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:56.360
.. immutability. Immutability is one of the great characteristics of these open public blockchains.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:06.160
Information stored in them cannot be retroactively changed - unless you have a closed private blockchain,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:14.220
in which case it is no longer immutable. It can be changed by whoever has the keys, which today is the...

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:23.180
.. corporation or consortium. Tomorrow, it's a gang of 14-year old hackers called Anonymous. They take over...

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:32.240
changing your "immutable" blockchain, which turned out was very mutable. If you take away the characteristics...

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:39.420
.. that make these open public blockchains interesting, what you end up with is stale, insecure, and boring.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:50.000
Be very skeptical when you hear a company say, "We're going to use a blockchain." 90% of the time, what they...

00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:01.800
.. mean is, "We're going to use a database." The reason is, the first hurdle that any company or government...

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:13.360
.. must overcome before they can really use this technology, is to relinquish the illusion of control.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:23.900
That's step one. You want to use "blockchain"? There are several open public blockchains. Use those! "But..."

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:33.400
"..we don't control them!" Exactly. Relinquish the illusion of control. Embrace the security of decentralisation.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:42.340
Embrace the innovation of the commons. Embrace the openness of global communication. Those are the...

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:50.200
.. revolutionary things, those are the things that make these technologies interesting. Give up control.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:58.640
That is very difficult to sell, it's a very difficult idea to even communicate within a large corporation.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:07.380
"You will be more secure if you have no control over this system." That is a very difficult concept to convey, [but]...

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:16.980
.. it is the truth. You have to be brave when you have these conversations. You have to be able to "call...

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:23.800
.. a spade a spade," as we say. I know this is not part of the culture here.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:31.460
American culture being very direct is, I'm sure - as in most of Europe - considered rude here. Right?

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:39.460
If your boss comes and says, "We're going to use a private blockchain," it is not proper to say...

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:48.460
"You know what, Bjorn? That's bullshit!" You can hire an American consultant to come in and do exactly that...

00:35:48.460 --> 00:36:00.120
.. little thing. It's probably much more credible if they're well-paid. But be brave! Speak your mind! If you see...

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:11.680
.. that what your companies are trying to do is simply a database, repeating business as usual, but sticking...

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:19.520
.. the word "blockchain" to make it sound cool and modern, it's not really a blockchain. It's just a database.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:27.960
Speak up and say, "That's not what this technology is designed to do." Ask the important questions.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:38.420
Which of the promises, features, capabilities of the open public blockchain are we trying to leverage with...

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.500
.. this application? What is it that this application

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:46.720
What [about] this application says that we need a blockchain? Because not every application needs one.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:56.160
In fact, very few applications need a global trust platform. It's inefficient, it doesn't scale.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:04.940
Democracy doesn't scale. Blockchains that are open and public are inherently egalitarian systems.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:13.040
That does not scale. It's not intended to scale. It's intended to be egalitarian. There's a difference.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:19.920
What are the principles you're trying to achieve? "We want to use 'blockchain' to put healthcare information-"

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:31.580
Really? Which part of open, neutral, censorship-resistant, borderless, transparent, resilient are you going to use?

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:39.800
At least five of those are antithetical to any application where you would put private healthcare information.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:49.420
I hear this a lot. How many of you heard of healthcare on the blockchain? Oh my god, it's a nightmare!

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:55.600
Can you imagine having your healthcare information on a public ledger that can never be changed, even if...

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:03.000
.. there's a mistake? We already have a system like that in the modern world: it's credit scoring. It's where...

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.520
.. a single corporation controls your credit rating and when they make a mistake, they don't have to fix it...

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:16.720
.. and you are punished for life for somebody else's erroneous data. Now we want to do this in healthcare?!

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:23.440
With our DNA? What a brilliant idea... Sign me out! I don't want anything to do with it.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:32.600
"Blockchain in transportation," "blockchain for clearance securities," "blockchain for logistics," "blockchain for..."

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:42.160
Blah blah, blah blah, blah... [For] 90% of those applications, the word "blockchain" means "database."

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:50.080
Learn the difference, teach the difference, and be brave enough to speak up when you see the difference.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:39:01.680
This technology is revolutionary because it is open, public, global. If you used it for the right applications,

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:11.080
the applications that need to be open, transparent, highly innovative, censorship-resistant, neutral, and global,

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:19.140
then this technology is really, really powerful. Use it for the right things. Thank you!
