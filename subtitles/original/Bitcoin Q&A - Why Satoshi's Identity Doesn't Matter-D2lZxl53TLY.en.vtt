AUDIENCE: Andreas, that was a great speech.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.840
What's your opinion why Mr. Nakamoto

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.740
haven't explained why

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.440
- what bitcoin is for exactly

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.480
and why do you think he decided

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.680
not to reveal his identity?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.700
ANDREAS: Well ...

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.560
in Greek mythology

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.780
there's the story of Prometheus

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.020
and Prometheus had the audacity

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.660
to steal fire from the gods and give it to man.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.340
And as punishment for that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.640
he was tied to a rock

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.120
where an eagle would eat his liver every day

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.040
and then overnight the liver would be regrown

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.140
so he could be tortured all over again.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.140
Satoshi Nakamoto stole money from the State -

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.920
not stealing the money itself

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.500
but stealing the technology of money

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.160
and giving it to man directly.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.100
And if we ever find out who Satoshi Nakamoto is

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.100
the most likely result

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.340
will be that someone will either metaphorically

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.560
or quite literally tie him to a rock

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.560
for an eagle to eat his liver out

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.760
- or her liver or their liver.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.340
The day after Nakamoto is found

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.700
we will discover from the media

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.180
that this person is a criminal, a terrorist,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.900
a Muslim, a lesbian, a vegan

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.580
[audience laughs]

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.260
an anarchist, a punk rocker,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.760
and biologically related to Justin Bieber.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.820
[audience laughs]

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.400
I just enumerated, you know,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.600
ten of the most horrifying things I can think of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.100
because that's what the media is going to do.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.760
Right?

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.460
Probably at the behest of governments.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.060
We've got to realize that Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.900
just in time.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.080
I think it's very wise

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.040
to recognize that Satoshi Nakamoto

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.440
is not a deity or a prophet

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.100
and that even though he, she or they

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.580
created a vision for what bitcoin could be

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.520
bitcoin is not theirs.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.060
And their idea of what bitcoin could be or is

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.360
is not divine truth.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.640
We are bitcoin.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.200
And bitcoin will always be "we"

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.460
not a single person.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.100
That's the whole point.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.520
And therefore it doesn't even matter anymore

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.740
what Satoshi Nakamoto thought bitcoin is.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.480
In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto was mostly

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.400
arguably unsure about whether this would actually work.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.180
They were extremely hesitant

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.100
to think that this would work.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400
So the bottom line is that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.740
Satoshi Nakamoto can't tell us what bitcoin is

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.140
because neither he, she, they, nor we

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.700
yet know what bitcoin will be.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.600
We are making history.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.780
We have to take responsibility

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.040
for the fact that we are part of making history.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.940
And part of making history means

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.120
that you have no idea what comes next

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.020
because it's never come before.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.440
And so you have to make your choices carefully

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.060
and with a long view into the future.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.780
So the stewardship of bitcoin has passed to all of us.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.460
What do you think bitcoin is?

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.320
Yeah, I would say I completely agree

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.740
that bitcoin is a platform, as a ledger

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.940
which gives you a creativity to create whatever you want.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.860
So in this point I completely agree with you.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.080
I completely agree with you in a lot of the points

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.020
but in this one, for sure.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.060
So, yeah, it actually gives you

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.040
the ability to build anything starting from the currency

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.260
from the payment system

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.540
and ending with ... with ...

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.300
the projects which are now built [inaudible]

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.340
And when you use the blockchain

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.040
to create the tokens for the trees in the Canada

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.420
and then when somebody's making a guitar

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.820
from the trees

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.720
you can follow the history of guitar in the blockchain.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.700
ANDREAS:  Why not?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.780
AUDIENCE:  Yeah.  That is also the great way to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.060
decrease the level of illegal ...

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.320
ANDREAS:  Foresting.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.120
AUDIENCE:  Yes, exactly.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.360
ANDREAS:  So here's the other thing.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.540
[audience applauds]

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.360
Here's the other thing that's really important to understand.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.060
Bitcoin doesn't have to be one thing.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.000
That's the whole point of a platform.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.540
It can be that to you

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.000
and it could be something completely different to me

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.460
and it could be a different thing for every one of you.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.320
In a system where you don't require permission

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.040
to innovate, to be creative

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.680
where in order to launch an application on the network

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.680
all you need is to create a new application

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.660
and then find someone else

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.380
who wants to interact with you using that application,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.900
the user base of a legitimate application is two.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.800
Okay?

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.160
For some applications, one.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.760
You don't need to focus group it or test it.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.980
Write a protocol definition,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.060
launch it on the network.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.700
It's like - how many people do you need

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.540
to run an application on the network?

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.440
Two at most.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.920
And that's enough

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.260
for that application to be meaningful to you.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.940
So bitcoin is

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.680
but bitcoin is also whatever you want it to be.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.040
It allows you to express

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.060
the application of just two people

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.300
and that's one of its magical capabilities.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.860
Because if you want to create

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.200
a financial application on our modern financial system

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.240
it has to be something that billions of people will use

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.180
profitably for the banks

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.900
which really means that you can only have

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.900
very few applications.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.920
So I think it's important to think about it

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.760
as something you own

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.340
and I own, and we all own.
