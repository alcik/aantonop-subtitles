00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.600
An expert on cryptocurrency, and ladies and gentlemen without further ado

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.260
Please help me give a warm malaysian welcome to

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.050
Andreas Antonopoulos

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.960
Thank you very much. Thank you

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.310
Hi, everyone

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.470
good afternoon, salaam alaikum. It's a real pleasure to be here

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.269
it's my first time

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.039
in Malaysia. I've now been in Kuala lumpur for less than 24 hours

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.219
and I'm enjoying it a lot

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.279
very much so. This is my latest book. It was published in September. It's called The Internet of Money

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.169
people often find that this is a difficult topic to understand

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.639
Bitcoin is a difficult topic to understand and I've published two books on it. The first book

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.309
Mastering Bitcoin, which is over there, is for software developers, engineers,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.419
technical people. How many people here are software developers, engineers, technical, anyone?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.189
Okay, so five people in this room can read that book

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.980
it explains how Bitcoin works

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.200
and you can probably read the first three chapters before you get into the very technical stuff and from that point on it

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.280
It's a bit challenging

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.250
it's challenging not because I aim it to be challenging

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.320
but because Bitcoin is a complex subject. Now for everybody who is not a developer

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.740
the reason I published that book, The Internet of Money is

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.639
this isn't about how it works. This is about why it matters and it's a collection of

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.879
eleven of my talks delivered in this format

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.129
and it explains the philosophy of money

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.749
the implications of Bitcoin on Society, and it's a book for everyone

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.880
It's the book I gave my mom to read and she doesn't understand anything about computers or money. So that's a good start

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.789
Great so before I get started. I'd like to get a feel for

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.810
the people in the audience

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.320
and get a bit of an understanding of how many people are familiar with these technologies that we're going to be discussing today

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.380
so by show of hands

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.680
Let's start with the narrowest. Which is: how many people here own Bitcoin?

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.820
Okay, someone did a good turnout for the community

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.110
Hi

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.860
Thank you for coming. hi. Thank you for coming

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.590
how many people have..

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.039
seen or conducted a transaction in Bitcoin, but don't own any? ...have just experienced it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.640
okay, just a few very good

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.420
and how many people have never conducted a transaction have no idea

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.049
what Bitcoin is or how it works and are new to this topic?

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940
Great, now

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.549
That was about maybe 30 people, I would say. Now for those of you, who are new to this topic,

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.590
what I'd like to suggest is that whether you understand or not what we're discussing today

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.100
And please ask your questions.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.089
I want to hear even the most basic questions about Bitcoin because I believe those are the most powerful questions

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.360
After we're done with the presentation

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.940
after we're done with the Q&amp;A

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.890
I would like to see as many of the people in the audience who have never experienced Bitcoin to install a Bitcoin wallet on your

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500
mobile device and

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.170
someone in the audience will give you, for free, some Bitcoin

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.830
not a whole Bitcoin

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.970
a fraction of a Bitcoin

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.029
just so you can see how a transaction works, and then you can turn to your friend who just started

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.190
and exchange Bitcoin with them, so you can experiment with this. I can assure you it's entirely legal. It's very easy to do

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.450
and it will allow you to really experience this technology, which is much easier experienced than it is

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.060
explained

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.740
so let's try the next question: How many people in this audience who have Bitcoin, have Bitcoin on their mobile devices, and are

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.349
willing to help people install a wallet and give them one or two dollars?
I will.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.399
Look around, the new people, look around who's

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.970
raised their hands find these people after the Q&amp;A.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.190
Ask them to give you a small amount of Bitcoin and help you set up a wallet. Don't be shy. I will be happy to do

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.190
it myself

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.060
All right with that. Let's get started with Bitcoin basics

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.400
In October of 2008

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.760
on an obscure

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.630
anonymous mailing list called the cypherpunk mailing list

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.079
an anonymous participant using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.640
announced

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.640
the publication of a paper

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.829
and said: 
I think I have solved a problem in computer science

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.699
I have found a way to create a system of electronic cash

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.860
That is direct between people, peer-to-peer as we use the term in computer science

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.980
in this system of electronic cash

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.369
I've written a white paper, and I have implemented it in Software

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.119
and on that day Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper. You can download it online

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.030
it's available at Bitcoin.org

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:09.300
You can do a search for it: the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper, or the Bitcoin white paper.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.660
And in nine pages, Satoshi Nakamoto described

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.990
in detail and in ways that predicted

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.259
many of the things that happened over the next seven years

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.190
What Bitcoin was, and what Bitcoin could become, and how it would work

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
But he didn't stop there

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.070
or

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.070
she didn't stop there

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.930
or they didn't stop there. Because we don't know if Satoshi Nakamoto is a man a woman or a group of people

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.560
Or an alien being from the future

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.120
Okay, probably not that last one

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.720
Satoshi Nakamoto, then published software and invited people

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.259
to participate in running a network and this gives you the first hint as to how Bitcoin works

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.919
Bitcoin is software

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.380
Bitcoin is an application

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.610
among other things

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.610
You download this application

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.260
You run it on your computer. You can run it on a laptop. You can run it on a desktop

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.130
Preferably on a computer that's permanently connected to the internet

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.690
It uses quite a bit of RAM and disk space right now

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.260
but in those days it was very lightweight

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.050
and if you run this program

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:39.559
it reaches out on the internet, and it finds other people running this program

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.790
you don't know who these people are

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:51.229
It doesn't reach out to specific people, it creates a random

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.479
mesh network, what we call a Peer-to-peer network

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.870
Where every participant in the system is equal

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.479
There is no special computer

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.539
They're all just talking to each other it

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.100
Creates what in network terms we would call a crowd

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:15.919
So, randomly reaches out and connects to various

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:22.639
other computers running the Bitcoin software and together they create a network

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.610
and that network is used to

00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:28.669
exchange and propagate

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.930
transactions

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.870
These transactions are encoded in a digital format. They contain information

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:40.369
about the transfer of value and the Authorization

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.400
to Transfer value between participants

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800
Nobody controls this network

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.040
and this is a critical concept, nobody controls this network

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.180
You can be running one of these computers. You do not control this network

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.620
You run one of these applications

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.730
It connects to other people and you run another one of these applications

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:17.379
And it talks Bitcoin to the other computers that are talking Bitcoin, but no one is in control. No one is in charge

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.840
just like

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.819
when you're running a computer that speaks on the internet

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.579
and communicates with other computers on the internet

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:35.950
No one is in control, if you interact directly between these systems

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.850
that network started

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.550
on January 3rd 2009

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.170
and on that day the world changed

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.329
for the first time in the history of money

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:59.199
in the history of Trust in the history of institutions in the history of humanity

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.749
a system that is completely independent of Authority is completely independent of institutions

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.150
a system that develops trusts as the result of collaboration

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.490
communication

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.609
and computation through cryptography

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.110
was born

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.110
this system allows

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:26.080
people to Exchange value to transmit money

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.890
and this money is called Bitcoin

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.279
So Bitcoin is the application. It's the software that you run on your computer

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.050
That communicates with all of the other computers running the Bitcoin software

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:48.369
Bitcoin is the name of the network that runs the Bitcoin network, which is the collection of all of these computers

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.110
some six and a half thousand of them around the world

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.750
Anywhere, there is internet

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:01.509
are the ones we know that advertise their presence several thousand more that don't

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.169
and tens of thousands that simply listen

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.979
onto this Network without actively participating

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:11.649
the Bitcoin Network

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.829
and all of this is an infrastructure that is used to

00:11:15.439 --> 00:11:19.059
Create and transmit value in the form of transactions

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.610
expressed in a new

00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:23.240
currency

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.509
the Bitcoin currency

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.360
and the Bitcoin Currency is

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.279
Unlike any other form of money we have ever seen before

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.379
first of all, as a form of money

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.769
it does not exist in physical form

00:11:42.439 --> 00:11:47.499
it is the culmination of a trajectory we've seen in human history

00:11:48.439 --> 00:11:49.970
over

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.319
thousands of Years

00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:55.419
Money has become a more abstract form of value

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.329
You start with very very tangible forms of value

00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:06.129
commodities

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.299
a goat, a banana, a pineapple

00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:14.589
These are very poor forms of money

00:12:16.129 --> 00:12:20.558
because you can eat them, and they rot or die

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.339
and they can be lost. They're not very good forms of money because they are the thing of value

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:35.438
We went from that to gold, precious metals, and stamped coins

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:43.688
These are better forms of money because you cannot eat them, they do not die or rot

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:51.039
They do not represent the value itself. They are not the value

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.860
and this is an interesting concept

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.850
Money is not the valuable thing itself

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:03.849
Money is the thing you exchange for the valuable thing itself

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:10.149
The reason bananas are not good money is because bananas are the value you're trying to get

00:13:11.809 --> 00:13:19.479
Money is the thing you exchange for bananas that has no value in itself. It is simply a symbol and abstraction

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.190
it represents

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:28.390
something that can be carried, that I can give to someone tomorrow and they will probably give me bananas

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.030
That future promise of value is the essence of money

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.619
So the essence of money is the ability to have an abstract

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:42.249
token that in itself is immutable

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.320
unforgeable

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.320
eternal

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.960
maintains its value

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.759
and represents the exchange of value in the future as a promise

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:02.259
and over time these things have become less and less physical and more and more abstract

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.900
Why?

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.050
because people don't like changing

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:14.230
and if you tell someone:
I'm not going to give you bananas for the work you did

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:19.689
I'm going to give you a shiny gold coin, but don't worry you can use this to get bananas

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.089
They look at you, and they say I've always had bananas for my work

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.689
I think I would like to have bananas, not this yellow thing

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.790
a hundred years later

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.110
they now believe the yellow thing is valuable

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.459
and then you tell them: Now I'm going to give you a piece of paper

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.350
instead of the yellow thing

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:47.350
but don't worry you can still convert this into bananas. And most people say: I don't think that's real money

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.279
I want the yellow thing and the world moves on

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.459
and eventually we change and we say:
You know what? You won't get the piece of paper either

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.340
You won't get the coin

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.190
You will go and look at

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.710
numbers on a page

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.930
or on a webpage

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.579
and that represents the amount you have in the bank, but don't worry you can still use that

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.930
to acquire food,

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:20.769
products, services, it really is money. You can't touch it. You can't see it. It's just a number.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.220
and finally we arrived at Bitcoin

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.259
Bitcoin has no physical form it doesn't exist in any way

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.569
it is entirely intangible, it cannot be touched

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.190
it is simply a digital form of money

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:45.059
But it is a digital form of money that is entirely different from everything we've seen before

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:53.580
What it does that is different? Is that it is not a form of money that is recorded in

00:15:54.490 --> 00:16:01.380
the database or records of a company. It is not a digital form of money that

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.720
represents a debt owed

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:11.760
to a central bank or government. It is not a digital form of money that has been issued by a sovereign,

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.240
a central bank, a nation, a king

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.070
It is a form of digital money that has been issued through

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.860
complex and energy intensive computation, on the internet

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.130
is recorded simultaneously on every computer that participates in the Bitcoin network

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.529
is validated independently by every computer that participates in the Bitcoin Network

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.049
Cannot be forged, cannot be counterfeited, cannot be censored

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.990
Cannot be seized or frozen

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.279
Can be transmitted anywhere in the world

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:57.659
as information. Can be verified independently by anyone who receives it

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.510
And is not controlled by anyone

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.170
Its value is not controlled

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.489
its issuance is not controlled, its ownership is not controlled

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.900
It is direct from one person to another person

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.859
with no intermediaries

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:21.389
If I use my mobile phone

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:30.059
to make a Bitcoin payment to someone in this room. I am creating a digital transaction

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:38.759
That recognizes the fact that a certain number of Bitcoin that the network knows belongs to me

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.540
through the proof of my digital signature

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.620
I have authorized the transfer of that value

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.240
to another

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.140
owner of

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.410
Bitcoin who will then be able to

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.589
control that Bitcoin through their own digital signature, through their own

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.769
cryptographic key

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.809
Now, you don't need to know anything about digital signatures or cryptographic keys

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:16.139
When you use Bitcoin you see an application on your mobile device or on your desktop

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.669
This application tells you you have three Bitcoin

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:27.569
It allows you to enter the address of a recipient which is a number just like an email address

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:34.199
it allows you to select an amount of Bitcoin you wish to transact

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.599
and when you click send on your application

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.000
it uses the digital signature and private key that is embedded in your device

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:54.209
to create and sign a transaction that is advertised to the entire Bitcoin network, and says, "I have transferred

00:18:54.790 --> 00:19:00.330
this value". And then the entire network now knows that this value belongs to someone else

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.830
They don't know who this someone else is, nobody knows

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.620
When you do a Bitcoin transaction, it is not related or attached to identity

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.679
You do not need to create an account

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:20.700
You do not need to register, you do not need to provide Id, or name

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.490
or location, or address, age

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.960
gender, race

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.250
religion

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.390
nationality

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.390
nothing

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.449
You don't even need to be human

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.820
and

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:42.330
You laugh, but it is true.
Bitcoin enables for the first time in human history

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.630
for non-Human entities to actively control and own value

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.269
Which is bizarre because we've never had that in any legal system in the world

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.359
we have the legal fiction of corporations, and corporations can own value, but corporations can only exist as

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.380
associations between living human beings

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.140
in Bitcoin

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.489
a software agent that is not owned by anyone

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.900
through the use of Cryptography can own

00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:20.490
and transact in

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.900
Bitcoin

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.900
internationally

00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:28.969
This creates some very interesting and also very disturbing

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.570
possibilities for the future

00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:34.559
artificial intelligence

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:40.819
systems can own and control money without any living human being involved

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.609
You can have corporations that have

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.250
no directors

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:51.229
No living humans in control that are controlled entirely by software

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:58.669
Back to people though if you are a person who has installed a Bitcoin wallet

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.080
you must pass

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.149
a complex test in order to install this software

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:14.120
You must be able to download an application. That's it!

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:20.209
Now if you happen to own an iPhone,

00:21:21.929 --> 00:21:25.609
you must remember your iTunes password

00:21:26.309 --> 00:21:33.829
in order to install an application. And so far, I have found that this is the most difficult part

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:40.730
of becoming part of the global economy of Bitcoin, is remembering your iTunes password

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:49.879
But if you can do that. If you can access the Google Play store. If you have basic familiarity with mobile applications

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:55.819
If you can download an .exe on Windows and install it. If you can double-click a mouse

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.739
That's it. You don't have to provide your name, your email address. You don't register or create an account

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:08.419
You don't have to prove who you are, where you are, or show that you are worthy

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:13.079
you do not have to have a credit score. You do not have to be authorized

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:20.699
This is something that is entirely different from every system of money we've ever had before

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:27.029
Now, for the internet generation this is a very familiar concept

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.740
When you open a browser, and you start using the web

00:22:33.639 --> 00:22:40.829
Do you have to register or get a license to use the web?
Do you have to create an account to visit Wikipedia?

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:49.830
No, the only requirement is that you are able to download install and operate a web browser

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:58.620
There was a time when the idea of allowing every human to be able to communicate

00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:02.699
without borders or censorship on the World Wide Web

00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:08.398
was terrifying to people. To some people it still is terrifying

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.949
Most of the younger generation find it liberating in a global sense

00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:17.669
Bitcoin does that to money!

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.549
What happens when every human being on the planet,

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.569
through the simple act of downloading and installing an application

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:33.120
can become a member of a global economy without borders, one that allows people to transmit and receive money at will

00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:35.049
anywhere in the world

00:23:35.049 --> 00:23:37.049
24 hours a day

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.079
uninterrupted for the last seven years

00:23:42.009 --> 00:23:50.699
With fees that do not depend on the amount of money you're sending, but paid simply for the capacity you use on the network

00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:55.378
You can transmit a Bitcoin transaction for about $1

00:23:56.110 --> 00:24:02.429
And it doesn't matter if you send $1 or $100,000 dollars, you still pay $1

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.929
It doesn't matter if you're sending it from here to another

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.580
province

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:15.179
in Malaysia, or if you're sending it from here to the opposite end of the planet

00:24:15.399 --> 00:24:17.110
it doesn't matter if

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:22.559
you are an individual or corporation, or if you're sending it to an individual or corporation

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:26.909
it doesn't matter if you're sending it to someone who is rich or someone who is poor

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.880
You can

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.570
Bitcoin changes

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:36.209
the way we approach finance completely

00:24:37.059 --> 00:24:39.059
But that's just the first layer

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:46.860
Because the technology that makes Bitcoin possible that allows two people from opposite ends of the planet

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:52.859
To securely transact with each other without knowing each other and without trusting each other

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.000
opens up

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.619
an entire range of applications that we haven't yet imagined

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:02.668
Bitcoin is not just money for the internet

00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:10.289
Bitcoin is a platform, the technology that Bitcoin uses, a combination of the blockchain

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.260
which is the global transaction ledger

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.780
that records every transaction

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:23.729
The decentralized consensus mechanism called proof-of-work that allows security on the Bitcoin blockchain

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:29.789
the open system of access that allows anyone to participate without barriers

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.029
and it's borderless and neutral nature

00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:37.678
that make it possible for anyone to participate regardless of who they are

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:44.309
Where the only thing that matters is whether a transaction IS valid, not who is the source or destination

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.010
not what is the amount

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.030
These fundamental building blocks that make Bitcoin possible

00:25:51.429 --> 00:25:58.559
open the door to dozens, and then hundreds, and then thousands of applications of trust

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.260
at its core

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:12.059
Bitcoin represents the replacement of 
"Trust through institutions" to "Trust through networks"

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.860
for centuries

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.189
Human Society has been based

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:24.839
on the fact that in order to coordinate the activity between large numbers of people we have to have

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:30.330
something to trust. And until now the best answer to that problem

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.940
was institutions

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:39.410
collections of people governed by rules policies

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:47.450
with oversight, transparency and accountability built into the rules, run by humans, in order to create centers of trust

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.190
through tradition, through reputation, through longevity

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.990
institutions of trust are failing

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:04.520
They're failing all over the world. They're failing when they are newspapers. They are failing

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:12.589
in political institutions. They are failing in numbers of ways, and the reason they are failing is because they represent

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.889
systems of scale for Industrial Societies,

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.889
and we are no longer

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.229
Industrial nation state societies

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:32.180
we are now information societies of global scale, that collaborate across borders at massive scale

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.180
We are now solving problems that affect, not 30 million people in one country,

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.869
but seven and a half billion people on one planet

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.450
and for problems of that scale

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.060
and collaboration of that scale

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:52.339
traditional institutions do not work, they fail to scale

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.640
They're not evil

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:03.349
They're not deliberately corrupt. 
They simply fail to solve the problems of a global society

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:10.820
and yet during that very time that we see these institutions failing, we have seen the emergence of new

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:18.800
systems of governance. Of new systems of Global Collaboration. Systems that do allow us to collaborate, communicate

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.169
and solve problems at scale

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.559
and the first of those systems was the internet

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.230
and with that

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.229
we see the first system of communication that transcends nations, that transcends borders

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:40.070
That allows anyone, everywhere, and anywhere to communicate

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:49.550
Bitcoin represents that, happening to money, it represents a metric network-centric

00:28:50.809 --> 00:28:54.439
system of money that is beyond the Nation-State

00:28:56.249 --> 00:29:02.689
a network-centric system of money that scales and allows people to collaborate on a global basis

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.699
That allows anyone everywhere and anywhere to participate in

00:29:08.309 --> 00:29:09.990
a global economy

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.939
without barriers, without borders, without ID

00:29:14.639 --> 00:29:16.639
without credentials

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:21.259
simply through the act of running Software

00:29:21.899 --> 00:29:23.070
and that

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.780
will change the world.
Thank you
