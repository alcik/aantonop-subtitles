00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.479
Um as Bitcoin becomes more and more popular and

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.099
More and more people are using they're already getting the problem now with the blockchain getting congested

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.630
- Yes
- easy time so it's been the talk of doing a fork

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:13.469
Yes

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.829
If it goes down the path of actually doing a fork, how will they, they roll that out, like, it'll be something that will happen

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.980
overnight, or it'll be over twelve months? And

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.439
If you own quite a lot of Bitcoin, how long would you have to have before you would have to,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.529
Like, change it over to the new, the new coins?

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.590
Alright, so how many of you have heard of this concept of Forks?

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.620
Okay, great, so quite a few.
And how many of you are worried?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.880
Oh, a few, okay, good. So generally not too much fear, uncertainty in that particular area

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.439
I just released a video on YouTube last week called 
fork-ology, a science of forks for newbies

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.440
And it's an entire topic

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.798
describing what a fork is, how it works, why it happens, and what do you do with it. But the bottom line is this -

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.529
If any cryptocurrency forks,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.629
Then, what happens is the end of the blockchain forks right, so

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.159
Imagine my arm as the blockchain, my elbow is the genesis block and it builds up

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.809
And then it bifurcates at the top.
Now, if you have money here,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.680
that is the common history of both sides

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.439
Meaning that both sides recognize that you had money in the past, meaning you have money on both sides.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.320
I'll use another little analogy

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.150
Jean-Luc Picard

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.359
gets on to the transporter station with five coins in his pocket

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.869
As usual a transporter malfunction occurs.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.899
right? Now,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.759
down on the planet Jean-Luc Picard materializes, but up on the Enterprise, Jean-Luc doesn't

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.630
dematerialize

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.299
Uh-oh, we have 2 Jean-Luc Picards, both of whom claim to be the original.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.299
And one of them wants to call the other one Jean-Luc classic, but

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:22.000
There's a lot of disagreement and they file claims of the patent &amp; Trademark Office because they both claim to be Jean-Luc Picard, the original,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.760
but here's the interesting thing

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.940
How many coins do they have in their pocket?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520
They both have five coins

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.059
Now, it may be that those coins have different value on the surface versus on the ship,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.929
but they both have five coins. If one of them spends those coins, then the other one still has their coins and

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.020
So they have now two different futures, even though they shared a common past

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.039
And so, one of them can go broke by spending all their coins

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.880
And the other one still has five coins and nothing's changed. What happens on one side doesn't affect the other

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.630
There will be some disagreements, however, if they fix the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.420
malfunction in

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.830
the transporter and re-merge the two Jean-luc Picard's

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.280
Because the one on the ship, who didn't spend any of his coins, will be rather annoyed that the other one, who spent all of

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.699
His coins and gained a few pounds because they were eating cake with them

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.009
So when they merge back, you have some nasty problems with the uniform not fitting

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.840
But the bottom line is if you have coins before, you have coins after on both Forks, the shared common history is one

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.369
You don't have to do anything.
What you have to be very careful is

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.790
That your clone doesn't open any new debt

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.619
Or, you know, create any situations that might affect your future

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.679
Right? So if you have money on both of the forks and you try to move money from one of the forks

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.809
There is a risk called a replay attack, where your transaction that you made

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.420
Intending to move on one of the forks

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.339
it is identical to the same transaction that could be done on the other fork and

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.019
Someone copies it over so your money gets spent on both forks.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.959
That is called a replay - it's not double spending because it only got spent once on each fork.
