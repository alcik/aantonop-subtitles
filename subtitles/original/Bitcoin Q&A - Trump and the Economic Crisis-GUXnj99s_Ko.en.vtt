00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
All the rhetoric from Trump about "draining the swamp"

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.980
and corruption in Washington, how do you see that

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.740
in relation to the Fed and all that crap? Thank you.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.640
Going on from that then, obviously what we saw

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.440
with Trump is like a failure of statecraft.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.460
No one within the DNC or RNC actually...

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.240
I think necessarily saw it coming.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.400
I'm talking about the parties, the pollsters.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.000
Yes, absolutely. I mean, people from [?] actually did

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.820
some group polling and actually predicted his win.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.700
But that seemed to be a failure of statecraft, right?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.200
It was an embarrassment for D.C.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.560
But don't we actually have a problem, though?

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.000
It's not the failure of statecraft that we need to point to,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
but actually... a failure in economics.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.460
...talking about the fact that we can see technology

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.820
everywhere, apart from in productivity stats.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.840
We have issues around productivity -

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.960
So the point is, one of the things I think would serve us

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.540
even better - you alluded to this in terms of applications

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.440
Shouldn't we be looking for engines for growth

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.880
rather than self-referencing innovation within

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.960
financial services and technology?
