00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.469
[QUESTIONER]: What do you think is the biggest technical hurdle to Bitcoin adoption and why?

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.460
[ANDREAS]: The biggest technical hurdle to Bitcoin adoption is the fact that it is difficult to understand,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.500
.. it is difficult to use, it is even more difficult to use securely, and we don't yet have the user interfaces,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:31.140
.. the compelling killer applications, and the cultural change that's required. It took years for people to...

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.740
.. understand how the internet worked, for applications to come out that were compelling enough for...

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.260
.. user interfaces &amp; user experience to become smooth enough, for people to become comfortable with it.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.280
Some of that is generational, right? Some people will never be comfortable with this new form of money.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.240
For anyone under 30 [years old], the idea of the internet running money sounds kind of obvious.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.240
Why would you do it any other way?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.800
Yet for some people, that is always going to be alien. The idea of trusting a mathematically-based network...

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.640
.. protocol is never going to be acceptable. Some people still don't accept currency that isn't physical gold, right?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.440
You'll see people who have that kind of attitude. That's four hundred years behind the transition, and yet...

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.600
.. they cling to that. Good for them! Not everybody has to come along for the ride; it won't be equal everywhere.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:39.600
In some places, bitcoin is being adopted quite rapidly today. I use bitcoin as my income and my expenses...

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:52.320
.. a lot of the time. A majority. Not all, can't do that yet. And I doubt my parents are going to become habitual...

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.500
.. bitcoin users. But my mom saved her retirement from Greek banks using bitcoin, and that's good enough.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.560
And it was worth doing. People will come at different speeds. The difficulty is, we need to build better...

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.980
.. applications, better security, better user interfaces. We need to explain, explain again, then demonstrate...

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.240
.. and help people grasp these fundamental changes to how money works. Eventually, what happens?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.080
It's just a matter of time. The idea of a network-based, decentralised form of money - that exists electronically...

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:38.600
.. and primarily serves an online, connected society - is done. It's baked. It happened. It will be the dominant...

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.360
.. system of commerce in the future. There is no question in my mind about that. How do we get there?

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.780
Who builds the really great apps? They're going to be very successful.
