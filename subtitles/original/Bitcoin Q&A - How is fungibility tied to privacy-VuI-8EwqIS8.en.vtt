00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.459
What do you think about the fungibility of a bitcoin?

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:12.689
Yes, somebody suggested that I should end my my talk with Liberté égalité a fungibility

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.799
That's an insider joke for us bitcoiners

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:25.019
Fungibility so first of all does anybody okay? Who does not understand the word fungibility or hasn't is not familiar with it great?

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.740
Let's talk about fungibility

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.619
So one Euro is one Euro is one Euro if you receive a Euro it

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.369
Doesn't matter where it came from it doesn't matter if two people before you it was stolen

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.640
It doesn't matter if two people before you it was robbed from a bank

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.739
It's a euro upon presentation that Euro is the same as every other Euro

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.919
And no one can say I'll take this euro

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.370
but I won't take that euro and and that is not simply a matter of

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.739
Practice that is a matter of law, and this law was settled in the 16th century

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.309
Where someone said actually?

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.019
That's my Euro

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.589
It was stolen

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.100
And they took someone to court

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.669
Who was not the person who stole it who was person who received it several times later and said that is stolen property

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.729
Okay, wasn't a euro. It was a franc or something like that. I think it was a pound sterling actually

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.600
And it was taken to court and the Court said you can't do that

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:30.209
So money is the one type of property that cannot be stolen and then recovered by the original owner if you steal money

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.789
Right you can't say that's my money

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.619
Give it back to people later. You can say it to the person who stole it

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.048
But you can't just walk into a shop and say I'm gonna. Sue you because you have the money that was stolen from me

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.770
That's fungibility

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.149
The reason we have fungibility in the currency is very very simple

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.329
otherwise it wouldn't work if

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.519
every time you received a euro you had to open a list or database and say okay serial number 1 3 1 3 3

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.680
7 7 - is that a good euro or a bad euro is it a medium here all the kind of naughty Euro?

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.170
Is it a bit cocaine eeeeh?

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.489
Is it a bit terrorist II?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.360
Because then it's not one hero

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.870
it's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.250
0.72 euros

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.330
it's

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.410
0.76 euros now this one's a bit too. Cocaine is 0.53 euros in value, right?

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.859
Oh this one was touched by Elton John it's 1.6. Euros

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.689
We don't accept that as a model for using currency and the reason we don't accept it is because it wouldn't work if you had

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.599
To check the provenance of every system of money that you receive

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.549
You couldn't make currency work and the reason you couldn't make it work is not

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.979
Just because you would have to track a database that had to be perfect and always updated with every coin in it

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.359
But the most important thing is that no euro would be worth one hero

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.209
Every Euro would be worth a different value weighted by how liquid it is how circular Bowl it is

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.560
Whether you could use it, right?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.789
So if you can use it but some places and not use it other places

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.629
Automatically its value drops and now you have to keep track of what the value of one hero is in here. Oh, right?

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.929
That's fungibility. It's the

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.189
understanding by law understanding by practice and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.130
Technological fact that every unit of currency is indistinguishable

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.959
Or is treated as indistinguishable from every other unit of currency

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.340
Bitcoin is fungible ish

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:52.819
Somewhat fungible in Bitcoin you can trace the provenance of every coin by practice

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.079
By custom. We don't do that

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:04.219
We are beginning to see some companies do that that is a problem if you go to

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.299
Bitstamp

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.410
coinbase

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.559
Zappo, and you say here's my bitcoin, and they say well three bitcoins ago

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.649
Or three transactions ago this came from Bitfenix

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.410
And we're gonna freeze your account

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.979
You have a problem right? So that's fungibility being destroyed right now in Bitcoin however at the same time

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.059
We're seeing a lot of technologies being developed to improve function t. Because fungibility also has to do with privacy and

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.099
Anonymity which are really important characteristics that we're trying to strengthen and at the same time preserve

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.369
within bitcoin and that means ensuring that

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.090
Transactions are private that you don't know who is who in a transaction that you don't know what value is being transmitted

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.510
There's a number of technologies being developed for that which make bitcoin

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.440
extremely private

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.309
Where you can't even see the value of the transactions being made you can't tell who is the Sender and who is the recipient?

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.460
You can't tell how much money is being paid and it?

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.570
really fixes

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.879
Fungibility because you simply can't track coins from one to another

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.200
and

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.280
This is the point where most people go, but what about criminals, but what about drug dealers, but what about?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.920
Terrorists aren't they going to use this to do that?

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.380
Yes

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.790
They're going to use this to do that and if you didn't do it in bitcoin

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.360
They're going to use another cryptocurrency that already does that there's half a dozen

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.980
Available that already do that. And if you say you can't use those I'll invent two. I'll write one this weekend this weekend that can do that

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.720
The bottom line is that criminals will use technology even if it's illegal

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.120
Incredible idea and so

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
banning Technology

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.929
Only effects the people who aren't criminals

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.880
Is this me this is Wild Philosophy I know

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.590
So you can't actually ban technology?

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.649
especially open-source technology because the only people who will be affected by the ban are the innocent and

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.380
the idiots

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.040
The people who couldn't figure out how to use the technology that actually allowed them to hide the sources of their money

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.960
So fungibility is something we're fixing in bitcoin because what it does is

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.960
It helps everybody

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.360
the innocent

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:43.759
the well-meaning the people who pay taxes and want to educate their children and feed their children and buy homes and cars and

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.000
operate in society protect their privacy from predators from corporations from

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.900
Tyrannical governments from Oppressive governments, and so we need to do privacy for them

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:03.949
and criminals will also use it that's my answer for fungibility. Thank you so much. That was a good last question. It's been a pleasure

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.949
Thank you, everyone
