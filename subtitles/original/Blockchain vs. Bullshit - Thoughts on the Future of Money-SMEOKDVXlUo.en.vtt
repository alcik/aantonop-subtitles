00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
and we're going to kick off with a
keynote on the future of money so it

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.080
really is about looking forward we're
going to have a future stargazing

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.950
session this morning and someone who
doesn't need a lot of introduction to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.269
other than to say he is a world-class
expert in his field has come to South

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.930
Africa to talk to us Andreas
Antonopoulos welcome South Africa and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.449
welcome to the conference hi good
morning everyone I am so excited to be

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.040
here
so this conference was called the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.730
Bitcoin conference a couple of years ago
and now it's the blockchain conference

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.770
next year it's going to be the DLT
technology and then after that is going

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.980
to be the database inspired by but no
longer in any way related to blockchain

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.190
conference it's an interesting
progression let me do a quick poll of

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.190
the audience I want to get an idea of
your level of experience and familiarity

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.000
with this space so I'm going to go back
to the yesteryears of Bitcoin how many

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.950
of you currently own Bitcoin fantastic
and those who don't own Bitcoin how many

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.939
of you have conducted a transaction or
seen a transaction happen in Bitcoin

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:28.680
great and how many do not own any
cryptocurrency of any type okay great

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:42.350
how about people who are involved with a
cerium and own aetherium great - Manero

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.690
Z cash
got some interesting okay how many own

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:56.120
blockchain how many have used blockchain
in a transaction or in any way other

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.160
than the five things I mentioned
previously all right

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.850
okay so break down for you for those who
can't see what the audience is doing

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.230
about 60 to 70 percent have a Bitcoin at
the moment or have conducted a

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.750
transaction about 30 or 40 percent with
aetherium smaller minority with -

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.030
montero's e cash nobody owns blockchain
and this is interesting this is exciting

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:37.990
great so let's get started what exactly
is going on here is this the greatest

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:45.200
technological innovation and explosion
of innovation since the mobile internet

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:54.790
or maybe even the internet itself or is
this the greatest load of hype ever

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:04.910
arranged around the technology in the
history of technology both and in fact

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.360
that's a characteristic of advanced
technologies I often say that where

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.730
Bitcoin and the other open block chains
are today is approximately where the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.040
Internet is in 1992 in terms of
technology in terms of infrastructure

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.170
deployment in terms of adoption patterns
this technology is approximately where

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.500
the internet was in 1992 but the hype
around blockchain is exactly where the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:42.100
hype around the internet was in 1998 you
know what comes next

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.760
there will be a shakeout when the waters
recede you can tell who on the beach

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.080
wasn't wearing a swimsuit they stand
there naked it's an empty promise this

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.720
will happen in the blockchain space

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:11.750
there is a lot a lot of bullshit being
peddled to VCS to investors to initial

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.140
coin offering buyers to uneducated
investors there's a lot of Ponzi schemes

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.040
there's a lot of pyramid schemes there's
a lot of empty promises there's also a

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.730
lot of businesses usual disguise this
innovation disguised as disruptive

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:38.870
technology and so we're at this strange
moment where the underlying technology

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:46.550
really is truly is massively disruptive
massively innovative the amount of

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.090
research that's happening today in
applied cryptography is unprecedented we

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.860
are looking at the largest civilian
deployment of public key cryptography

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.910
ever because it turns out that people
only protect keys when those keys are

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.690
attached to value and nothing teaches
someone security fast enough than having

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.850
their Bitcoin on a Windows machine

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.630
holding your own Bitcoin very quickly
changes your attitude towards

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.230
information security you didn't care
about your photos some didn't even care

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:35.550
about your sexy photos you didn't care
about your location the fact that

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.420
everything you do was tracked you didn't
care about posting your entire life on

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.420
Facebook you use the same password
password 1 2 3 4 on 17 different sites

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.580
you didn't know what two-factor
authentication was and then bitcoin

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.630
happened and suddenly you're on a steep
learning curve and getting better every

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.060
day
now you're telling your friends about

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.740
two-factor authentication and you're
horrified to remember how you used to

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.550
practice security because storing value
has this unique ability to focus your

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.520
mind on the aspects of security that
matters so this technology is driving

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.860
this groundswell of security awareness
it's driving the most incredible

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.800
research and applied cryptography we've
ever seen some of you are probably quite

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.910
technical you're involved in computer
science you've seen what's happening

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.790
here nobody thought that we would be
doing Applied Schnoor signatures nobody

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.980
thought we'd be looking at advanced
elliptic curve applications nobody

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:48.480
thought we'd be doing things like ring
signatures and range proofs for

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.760
confidential transactions the state of
anonymity and privacy is advancing

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.730
rapidly we're building a whole new world
in terms of cryptography and this is

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.930
applied cryptography on the largest
cryptographically secured network the

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:14.950
world has ever seen that's not business
as usual it's highly disruptive now out

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.380
of that came this fantastic saying
blockchain is the technology behind

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:28.360
Bitcoin which is incorrect blockchain is
one of the four foundational

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.190
technologies behind Bitcoin
and it can't stand alone but that hasn't

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:40.000
stopped people from trying to sell it
blockchain is Bitcoin with a haircut in

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.700
a suit that you parade in front of your
board it's the ability to deliver a

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:51.190
sanitized clean comfortable version of
blockchain of Bitcoin to people who are

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:57.970
too terrified of actually disruptive
technology and so you get into this very

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:04.380
strange world where the words no longer
mean anything

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:11.440
can you define blockchain for me I think
a few people in this room could probably

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.390
define blockchain but the real challenge
would be can you define blockchain in

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:21.040
such a way that I can do search and
replace with the word database and still

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:27.030
make that sentence work because that's
the challenge if what you're doing is a

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:34.840
database with signatures it's not
interesting it's boring what is the

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:43.300
essence of Bitcoin it's not blockchain
the essence of Bitcoin is the ability to

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:51.070
operate in a decentralized way without
having to trust anyone the essence of

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:58.360
Bitcoin is to be able to use software to
authoritative lis independently without

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.900
appeal to Authority verify everything
yourself you don't trust the other nodes

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.720
you're talking to you assume they're
lying you don't trust the miners you

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.490
don't trust the people creating the
transactions you don't trust anything

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:22.060
other than the outcome of your own
verification and validation and through

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:28.050
that you end up trusting in something
more important the network effect

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.260
Bitcoin introduced the concept of
decentralized security through

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:38.980
computation and this has not yet sunk in
what Bitcoin does is it allows you to

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.080
replace a security model that is based
around concentric circle

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.730
most of access and control with an
institution in the center with a

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:54.790
security model that is inside out open
and accessible to everyone a security

00:09:54.790 --> 00:10:01.690
model that is based on market forces and
game theory it is the first market based

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:08.620
security model where a series of
incentives and punishments ensure that

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:14.350
the ultimate result is you can trust the
platform itself as a neutral arbiter

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:20.460
that is not controlled by anyone without
third parties without intermediaries

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:28.210
Bitcoin revolutionizes Trust now it's
difficult to have that conversation if

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:33.190
you only focus on Bitcoin and arguably a
lot of people have said but it's not

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.420
just about currency what about the other
applications and it's not just about

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:43.750
Bitcoin what about the other block
chains and so in that sense the term

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:50.620
blockchain means something but only if
you define it very very narrowly I use

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:57.040
the qualifier open to talk about open
blockchain what I'm interested in is the

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.860
applications of this technology that
enable you to run a decentralized

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:07.720
trustless system that does not rely on
anyone as an intermediary of trust

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:18.220
because that is the disruption here that
is the essence technology so that

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.930
essence is seen in other systems
aetherium exhibits it for the

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.250
application of smart contracts but those
smart contracts only work if you don't

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:33.190
have to trust anyone to execute the
smart contract correctly and you can

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:38.050
only trust that that's going to happen
if everyone can participate in an open

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:43.720
manner and verify each other if access
to the underlying consensus algorithm

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:51.670
and mining is open to everyone and so
out of these characteristics come power

00:11:51.670 --> 00:12:02.019
of these blockchain technologies open
and that's the keyword borderless there

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:10.089
are no borders transnational this is no
longer about nation-states this is about

00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:17.529
network centric trust without third
parties the network is the trusted party

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:23.019
and only if you verify everything
neutral because it isn't serving the

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:27.879
goals of any one organization or
institution it follows the consensus

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:33.160
rules neutrally everyone follows the
consensus rules neutrally your

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:39.509
transaction there is no such thing as a
good transaction or a bad transaction a

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:45.189
valuable transaction or spam transaction
an authorized transaction or an

00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:50.579
unauthorized transaction a legal
transaction or an illegal transaction in

00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:56.559
these systems there is only a valid or
an invalid transaction based on the

00:12:56.559 --> 00:13:00.759
consensus rules and it doesn't matter
who the sender is who the recipient is

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:06.989
or what the value or asset or smart
contract that's being executed is

00:13:06.989 --> 00:13:18.249
neutrality radical neutrality and of
course censorship resistance the ability

00:13:18.249 --> 00:13:22.660
to ensure that in order for the system
to be open and borderless and

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:29.739
transnational and neutral it must be
able to defend these properties by

00:13:29.739 --> 00:13:35.679
making it impossible for any actor or
even several colluding actors from

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:44.579
censoring disrupting blacklisting
restricting ceasing freezing

00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:52.329
transactions users countries from
participating in this network those are

00:13:52.329 --> 00:14:00.759
the important characteristics of these
new open decentralized systems of trust

00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:05.129
that do not depend on institutions

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:13.480
so what I'd like to equip you with is a
set of criteria to understand when you

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.990
are being presented with something
perhaps to invest or to be employed or

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:25.300
to engage in some way and it calls
itself a blockchain or a distributed

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:31.439
ledger or one of these other names that
are coming out how can you tell

00:14:31.439 --> 00:14:39.069
blockchain or bull shit they both start
with a B what's the difference if you

00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:44.579
can replace the word blockchain with
database and the brochure reads the same

00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:50.230
it's business as usual it's not
decentralized it's not borderless

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:57.660
neutral censorship resistant open it
re-establishes trust in intermediaries

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:04.540
it's just the database and that is not
disruptive the idea we're going to take

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:12.550
this technology and use it to improve
the operating margins of centralized

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:18.000
institutions of trust so that they can
continue business as usual

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:27.970
I'd say it's abhorrent but that's a
strong word it's just boring really

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:33.939
really boring
no one got into this in order to make a

00:15:33.939 --> 00:15:40.810
few billions for a financial services
Clearing House and if you did I'm really

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:47.589
sorry that's boring
what's really exciting is the

00:15:47.589 --> 00:15:54.360
possibility of fundamentally changing
the way we allocate trust on this planet

00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:02.740
opening up the ability to collaborate
transact engage on a global level with

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:10.540
everyone simply by means of downloading
an application you can become part of a

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.899
giant platform of trust that doesn't
care who you are where you came from

00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:19.330
that doesn't require permission to
participate or

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:26.920
innovate we're a 12 year old JavaScript
programmer has the same influences power

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:34.540
as JPMorgan Chase more in fact because
they're doing open source and feeding

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:43.290
into a community of collaboration that
is creating a tsunami of innovation

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:51.089
taking this technology and using it to
strengthen the same centralized

00:16:51.089 --> 00:16:59.950
institutions so that they can improve
their bottom line is boring that is not

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.510
what blockchain is that's just the
database and it doesn't change anything

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:13.300
in fact there are some rather disturbing
possibilities in this model let's think

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:19.270
about it for a second
the most commonly expressed application

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:25.240
for these new distributed ledger
technologies is to replace the function

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:32.200
of a centralized clearing house with a
consortium of n participants where n is

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:41.950
2 3 4 5 10 known permissions controlled
participants who will assemble

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:47.470
transactions and sign them rather than
compete through market forces in a

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:53.919
security model like Bitcoin we discard
currency as the underlying mechanism for

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:59.020
building market based security we
discard proof of work as wasteful

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:04.090
because all it allows you to do is the
centralized secure neutral censorship

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:14.160
resistant blockchain and we trust 5
named parties to sign transactions at

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:20.169
that point they don't need to assemble
these transactions in blocks they can

00:18:20.169 --> 00:18:24.510
just sign the individual transactions
they don't need to chain them together

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:29.890
because absent proof of work and a
system of currency incentives rewriting

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:36.370
that is easy there's no immutability
so it's not a blockchain anymore because

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:43.540
there's no blocks and there's no chain
now that's at a technical level but

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:48.250
let's look at the more important level
what do you achieve by replacing a

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:53.950
Clearing House with a consortium of
players you know there's something

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:59.820
unique a clearinghouse does if you
understand the role of a clearinghouse

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:05.680
one of its most important functions is
that it is not a participant in the

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:13.570
market it has no skin in the game the
New York Stock Exchange is not an active

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:22.000
trader that's not an accident
that's called separation of concerns the

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.240
Clearing House is an independent party
with oversight that is not a market

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:34.630
participant if you take that party out
and replace it with five banks all of

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:41.230
which have skin in the game how do you
run a consensus algorithm when the

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:48.670
incentives to cheat front run manipulate
the market and break the consensus rules

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:54.700
even adversarially against the other
four parties are so high there's no

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.080
incentive to keep the consensus rules
all you're doing is you're saying trust

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:11.140
us we're in a consortium trust us these
five banks where were you in 2008 where

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:15.910
were you when Lieber was fixed where
were you when the gold markets were

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:21.340
fixed when were you in front running and
high-frequency trading was creating

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:30.700
these monsters of crony capitalism trust
us hell no removing the Clearing House

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:39.070
and replacing it with what's the word
it's not consortium cartel that's the

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:44.380
word
with a cartel of the same market makers

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.690
who have manipulated and compromised
every market in history and doing that

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:56.070
in a way that closes this from
transparency that's not a recipe for

00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:02.970
efficiency immutability security
transparency that's not a blockchain

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:11.800
that's a bullshit it's a very profitable
bullshit it requires you to have

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:23.650
confidence in the game a con game as
it's known be careful what you evaluate

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:30.670
when you see these technologies taking
something whose fundamental purpose is

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.960
to remove trusted intermediaries and
create an open borderless neutral system

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:41.710
and turning it into a tool for a bunch
of untrustworthy trusted parties to

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:48.360
manipulate markets is going to be a
disaster and they're going to do it I

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:58.360
have some consolation in the fact that
their keys will leak because when you

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:05.500
centralize a system you have to keep the
security of those five keys and none of

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:13.080
them have ever managed to do that all of
the companies involved in this brave new

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:21.040
business as usual space have been hacked
breached leaked whistle blown a dozen

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:28.210
times they can't keep information secure
no one can the whole point of a

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:33.010
decentralized blockchain is you don't
keep the information secure you spread

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:38.890
it out so thin there's no place to
attack it directly that's what makes it

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.540
secure so what happens when you
concentrated among five participants I

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:51.420
can't wait until the anonymous WikiLeaks
collaborative dump

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:57.280
the Titans of Wall Street and their
ledger of every transaction they've ever

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.300
done
I can't wait it's going to be so much

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:08.170
fun and it is going to happen
you cannot secure these things so does

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:17.950
that mean there's nothing there no again
we go back to the other side there is an

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:23.590
incredibly promising technology and that
technology is based on an architecture

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:32.050
of openness people are examining this
market and they're grasping and reaching

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:38.560
out in darkness when you have a
brand-new disruptive technology you

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.790
can't see the margins
it's like stumbling around a dark room

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:47.470
somewhere there is a billion dollar
company somewhere in there is an

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:53.620
opportunity and you have to figure out
what market exists the will create

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:59.490
opportunity that will change the world
that will have an impact on humanity

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:05.790
entrepreneurs look at other people's
problems and see them as opportunities

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:11.500
when journalists in 1997 were writing
about the imminent failure of the

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:16.480
internet because of the impossibility of
finding anything Larry Page and Sergey

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:23.230
Brin were finding stuff and building a
multi-billion dollar empire on solving

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:32.020
the unsolvable problem of search there
are seemingly unsolvable problems in the

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.730
open decentralized public transparent
neutral censorship resistant global

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:42.750
trustless Network platform that is the
blockchain and these other block chains

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:48.100
Bitcoin aetherium and the many other
systems that are gradually trying to

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:55.270
find their niche where are those markets
there are three elements to success in

00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:00.370
this industry the first one is
identifying a viable market right

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:05.290
you've got to stumble in the dark and
find something useful and very often

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:09.429
the people stumbling in the dark they
don't find anything useful right

00:25:09.429 --> 00:25:21.100
in 1997 Petco was building a online
commerce empire for pet supplies it was

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:27.340
too early the market didn't exist web
grocer Webvan was delivering groceries

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:33.360
to homes in San Francisco failed
miserably was that the right market

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:40.059
maybe but it was the wrong time so
that's the second important element

00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:46.960
right timing you can identify something
that at some point will be enormous but

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:54.820
you're off by a decade and then the most
important factor sequencing the

00:25:54.820 --> 00:26:02.650
prerequisites why did Facebook not
happen in 1992 you didn't have enough

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:07.720
density of adoption you didn't have
mobile devices that were permanently

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.870
connected you didn't even have
home-based internet that was permanently

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:16.059
on you didn't have a dense social
network in order to engage with the

00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:20.470
people you knew because the people you
knew barely had email or didn't have

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:28.330
email right so you can't build a system
of complexity that depends on many too

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:33.610
many interaction with high density when
you're still doing applications that are

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:40.150
one-to-one with low density right it's
like trying to fuse hydrogen directly

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:46.809
into carbon can't do that
you've got helium lithium beryllium you

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:51.820
got a long way to go keep smashing
things together before you get enough

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.840
density that you can start doing
interesting things in organic chemistry

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:04.480
right to use an example from science
bottom line is you can't do advanced

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.419
Real Estate's
title applications voting on the

00:27:07.419 --> 00:27:14.770
blockchain retail markets you can't do
consumer to consumer dense markets you

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:21.940
can do points of sale
all retail with these systems yet you

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.830
can do most of the things yet there
might be very interesting markets and

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:31.210
the reason you can't do them is because
there's not enough liquidity there's not

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:35.049
enough users is not enough adoption the
user interfaces are terrible the

00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:39.400
applications are still at their infant
stage that doesn't mean these things

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:46.000
can't happen it just means they're not
happening this year we're going to see

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.970
this play out in order for people to
have the trust to put the title of their

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:59.500
home on blockchain it has to be able to
secure not billions but trillions of

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.730
dollars in assets and in order to be
able to secure trillions of dollars in

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.570
assets it has have liquidity and
infrastructure it has to have broad

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.530
adoption you're not going to get
adoption on a transaction that most

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:16.299
people do twice in their lifetime when
you can't even get them to use it for

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:22.809
transactions they do every day right
we're not going to be doing digital

00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:29.470
identity so that everyone can have a
bank account because it takes a long

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:34.270
time until you have adequate adoption
for the first 15 years of the internet

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:40.660
the application was email and not until
everybody had it had to have it needed

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:46.299
it for work did we see the second layer
emerge because that created the density

00:28:46.299 --> 00:28:53.400
of adoption and currency is the email of
blockchains

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.540
payments are the fundamental
infrastructure that will enable density

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:10.559
of adoption it's very very enticing to
say this is about more than money it is

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:17.880
absolutely in the long-term the vision
of this technology is far beyond money

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:23.290
but you can't build that unless you
first build the money part that's what

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.640
creates the security that's what creates
the velocity the liquidity the

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.060
infrastructure that what funds the
entire ecosystem

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:40.820
and in the end when we do deliver
perhaps digital identity to people it

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:47.710
won't be so they can open a bank account
because this isn't about banking the

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:59.330
unbanked
it's about D banking all of us thank
