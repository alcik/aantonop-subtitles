00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.200
Simple rule: if you control the keys, it's your bitcoin.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.000
If you don't control the keys, it's not your bitcoin.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.200
Your keys? Your bitcoin. Not your keys? Not your bitcoin.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.479
Your keys? Your bitcoin. Not your keys? Not your bitcoin.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:23.429
Here's the problem: a lot of people have no idea how to even start to decide if they actually control the keys.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.680
So let me ask you a question...

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.340
How many of you control your bitcoin with your own control over your keys?

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.600
I'm counting myself here. Very good...

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.600
How many people do not control their bitcoin...

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.900
but have it in an online account?

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.680
Or somebody else is controlling the bitcoin?

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.500
Don't be shy! It's okay, we all started there. Okay...

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.280
More importantly, how many people have no idea how to answer that question?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.600
You don't know if you control it, right?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400
Okay, so let me give you some advice.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:10.000
If you are running a wallet where, each time you do a transaction, it generates a new address,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
... but when you started using that wallet, it told you something like "Write down these twelve words..." or

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
"these twenty-four words, and keep them as a backup."

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.600
Those words? They generate all your keys.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.460
The reason you have to write them as a backup is because you are controlling those keys.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.600
If you lose those words, you lose the keys &amp; the bitcoin.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.220
With great power comes great responsibility.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.360
If you have a wallet in which you were asked to write down the backup, you control the keys.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.400
If you didn't write down the backup,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.700
when you go home tonight would be a good time

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.620
to open the settings, go to "Backup," and write down those damn twelve words before you lose your phone...

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.520
or drop it in the toilet because you were trying to text while in the bathroom. We all do it...

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.140
You dropped it in the toilet and your bitcoin disappeared because your phone blew up, and then what?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.420
You call the "Bitcoin help desk"?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.240
There is no "Bitcoin help desk."

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.900
You go on Reddit and [say], "I lost my keys! Please, can someone help me?"

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.400
And what are people going to say?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.520
Did you write down the twelve words? You didn't?

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.900
Sorry for your loss...

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.780
All right... How do you know how to do a backup?

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.280
How to control your own [keys]?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.500
A lot of people don't know how to start, so I'm going to give you a very quick, little tutorial

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.340
on how to control your own keys. Okay?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.360
First of all, what is the most secure device you own?

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.760
Not your laptop! Definitely not your laptop.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.620
How many here have Windows?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.240
My sincere condolences...

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.940
You don't own your Windows machines. Your Windows machines are owned by a combination

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.660
of viruses and trojans, that are controlled by Russian and Chinese hackers somewhere else in the world.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.540
They're not really your machines. They just let you use them occasionally. Do not put bitcoin on those devices.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.140
That's like making a donation to hackers.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.600
They have software actively looking for Bitcoin software; when they find it, they take it. Or they put a key logger...

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.140
wait for you to do a transaction, enter your password,

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.140
and then they take it.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.940
The most secure device you own is your smartphone.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.600
Android, iOS? It's the most secure device you own.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.060
Operating systems on smartphones are far more secure than laptops and desktops, especially Windows.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.760
Your smartphone is probably the best place to run a wallet.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.460
if you have a lot of money invested in cryptocurrencies, or own a lot of bitcoin...

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.420
The word "a lot" means different things to different people, but if you feel like it's "a lot"...

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:21.880
If right now I told you your bitcoin has just been stolen, do you [say], "Eh... I'll get some more"?

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.480
Or do you start crying?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.540
Or do you have to have a very difficult conversation with your parents and your spouse

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.440
about why your kids won't be going to college?

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.220
Those are the variations in the word "a lot" of [cryptocurrency], right?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.320
If you have a lot of [cryptocurrency], more than what you would be upset to lose,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.480
you should buy a hardware wallet.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:55.240
A hardware wallet is a USB device. I can recommend a couple of those: Ledger, Trezor. Those are really good.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.820
*BitcoinTrezor.com (now Trezor.io), LedgerWallet.com, KeepKey... there's a bunch of others.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.220
They're a bit difficult to buy right now, because apparently about a million people noticed

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.800
that the bitcoin price went up, decided to finally join this thing, then went out and tried to buy a hardware wallet,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.440
so they're out of stock. That's a good problem to have.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:27.640
A hardware wallet is a little USB device which keeps your bitcoin keys on a highly secure, special purpose device.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.920
Even if your computer is absolutely full of viruses and hackers, you can use that device securely

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.440
because everything happens on the device, and the device itself can't be attacked over USB.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.420
Or it's almost impossible.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:50.000
So, buy a hardware wallet. If you can't buy a hardware wallet, download software onto your smartphone.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:01.220
If you have iOS, I could recommend Breadwallet, Mycelium, Copay, or Airbitz.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:11.100
If you have an Android [phone]: Mycelium, Copay, or Airbitz.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.500
I don't work for any of these companies, and I haven't taken money from any of these companies.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.100
They are just ones that I've used; they've been around for a while, I trust them to be much better than

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.240
whatever else you are doing right now.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.420
Download those wallets, install them on your smartphone, and then when it tells you to

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:37.440
make a backup of your twelve to twenty-four English words -- don't get smart, don't get fancy.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.960
Don't say, "Well, I'll write three of the words here..."

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.200
"... and then I'll take the other three words, reverse them, put them in my phone book, hide them in my library...."

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.560
"...give them to my cousin-" Don't get fancy!

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.000
Paper, pencil. Write down the 12-24 words.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.560
The chances that someone is going to get hold of that and know what it is? Pretty slim.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.860
Put it in a drawer, lock it. Put it in the safe, lock it.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.140
Then you can use your phone. If you lose your phone, you have the words.  If you lose the words,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:10.000
you have your phone. Both are equivalent. Any time you want, restore from those words. All of your transactions,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.740
all of your money, you get back.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.980
Now you control your cryptocurrency.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.360
These wallets, many of them- Jaxx is another one, if you have multiple currencies and not just bitcoin.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.100
If you have ether, Dash, Monero, Zcash, LTC, whatever.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.680
Jaxx. J-A-X-X.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.940
Exodus?

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.920
Exodus?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.640
Never heard of it. I don't know if it's-

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.880
That doesn't mean it's not good.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.960
I'm just saying I haven't personally heard about it. Okay...

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:55.500
Download one of those wallets. Write down the phrases, pencil on paper, right? If our civilization ended tomorrow,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:05.740
in one month... two months, all of the CDs, DVDs, hard drives, USB drives, would be dust.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:12.920
Okay, maybe not three months. But three thousand years? Dust. We're still finding paper from the Egyptians!

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:24.060
Paper lasts, yes? Paper. Don't put it on a USB drive. Paper. Simple, acid-free paper will last for

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:34.540
hundreds of years; if you're extra paranoid, you laminate it so that it cannot get destroyed by water.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:42.580
You buy a very inexpensive, fire-proof safe from your office store. You put it inside so it can't be burned.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.900
Flood, fire, theft... covered!

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.500
Now on that kind of system -- of wallets, hardware wallets with your backup words -- you can store...

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:59.300
... I know people who store millions of dollars (I'm not joking) on exactly that kind of of system.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:06.640
Once you have control of your bitcoin, it doesn't matter if there's a fork, it doesn't matter if your exchange decides

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.120
to go one way or another. It doesn't matter. You should not be keeping your money on that exchange.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.620
You should not be keeping your money [by trusting] someone else to keep it safe for you.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.920
That's just a bank. Part of the reason we're doing this open blockchain is because we don't trust banks.
