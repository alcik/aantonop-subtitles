What I wanted to talk about today is

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.859
The concept of a killer app and how we're going to find the killer app in

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.810
This space. It's a topic that comes up with bitcoin

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.990
Also, and one of the most common questions. I get asked is what is the killer app?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.700
So do you have some thoughts about? [what] is the killer app in?

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.930
Ethereum?

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.640
and

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.939
Replacing bitcoin isn't the correct answer by the way

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.200
You know this is this is an interesting question

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.360
When [people] look out at the landscape of all the possible applications that might exist whether it's in Bitcoin, or ethereum?

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.580
 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.090
You kind of map out what you think might be [a] space?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.300
That's not always

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.199
The first thing that will happen you know some applications require

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.809
prerequisites they require infrastructure, or they require a large concentration of

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.309
users in a specific geography or they require an

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.368
Industry that has a lot of users all working together to adopt a technology

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.519
[you'll] get you know the same applications in the beginning of technology as you do after it's matured for a while

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.809
Think about the internet for a while and look back. I I was around in the early days of the internet

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.780
I remember in 1992 like everybody knew [that] video on demand was going to be an apple. It's a no-brainer

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.079
You don't

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.279
You don't really need a [lot] to [figure] out the video demands will be a killer app now

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.169
I remember the first video conferencing demonstration I participated in it involves two

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.579
rooms about two million pounds worth of equipment and a connection over fiber between the university of London and

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.430
[A] University in the United States

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.869
It was the culmination of a two-year project, and it was pretty much what you would do today on a skype call

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.549
so

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.599
Video on demand. Obvious, but not yet

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.810
Not going to happen anytime soon and kind of Netflix or something like that the ability to do that

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.899
Certainly not going to happen anytime soon

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.979
[so] you have to think when we're thinking about the killer app II

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.110
It's not simply the set of applications that might possibly be [implemented]. [it's] also

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.230
What can be implemented with what you have today?

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.899
[what] requires the least infrastructure investment what requires the least density of users and yet?

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.800
provides a viable solution to a real problem and

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.809
That's the question that I spend a lot of time thinking about now in bitcoin

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.100
we kind of see where that is [going] there is an intersection of

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.749
[high] [value] Cross-Border payments that are particularly difficult

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.269
Difficult because there is currency controls difficult because your government is nuts and the printing one hundred Trillion Dollar bills

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.850
difficult because

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.169
You have very high fees or low opportunities for banking

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.099
That's a sweet. Spot right and the reason it's a sweet. Spot is because it doesn't take much to be better

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.999
Like you can be slow and all you have to do is not be as slow as the banks you can be expensive

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.429
and all you have to do is not be as

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.619
Expensive as the banks and you have a viable solution to a real problem and all

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.030
It takes to adopt that solution is the sender in the recipient for this, but you don't need massive infrastructure to do that

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.120
[ok] so what is

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.119
What is in fact the killer app for?

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.180
Ethereum and

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.149
Then bitcoin we've gone off the rails and everybody's done blockchain crazy

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.700
Let them call it blockchains as the t-shirt making fun of this idea that everything is a blockchain, right?

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.159
Anything that used to be a database is now a blockchain and suddenly magical it acquires

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.780
these capabilities

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.640
Immutability Censorship resistance neutrality Borderless operation etcetera which are not really characteristics of a blockchain?

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:22.749
There are characteristics of specific types of block chains, but if you just take a databases, [I'll] show up some hashes in it

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.809
That was not an immutable block chain make

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.100
um

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.879
But it makes some good money for consultants. So if everything is a block chain right? So what's happening in Ethereum? Everything's a dapp!

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.149
app + D [equals] Dapp! (audience laughs)

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.100
Let's dapp this dapp that dapp the next thing let's dapp everything everything dapp, dapp the world

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.029
which is kind of the same thing and

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.810
also

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.730
It attracts all the wrong kind of attitudes the wrong kind of people

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.630
Right? The Sharks start circling they're like "there's money in the water." there' VC's throwing money at stuff

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.159
They don't understand we've got a hype tournaments the new web 2.0. Let's run for it

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.080
Let's take what we were doing before slap blockchain in front and now what we're doing is cool, and most importantly fundable

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.299
Let's take what we were doing slap dapp in front of and what we're doing is now fundable

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.379
And there's a danger there and you're seeing it already

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.810
I don't want to be too harsh on the 
Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (laughs)

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.649
these are not your friends [ok?] the idea that all of these enterprises are going to bring their

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.020
magnanimous attention down to your technology

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.399
and make it suddenly shine in their enterprise applications for the most part what they're interested in is forking the code and

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.929
Creating closed boring versions of it that they can sell to management and as long as you're not doing anything disruptive

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.450
They're going to ride the Ethereum pony for a while

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.440
but eventually

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.970
Mark my words

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.510
There's going to be a time [when] what you do is disruptive and interesting enough [that] they're going to say the Magic words

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.109
We're interested in the technology behind Ethereum. Dapps, not Ethereum itself

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.110
sound familiar?

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.929
Mark my words that's going to happen unless you don't really do anything interesting

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.070
But if you do that's what's going to happen so again. What is the killer app?

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.740
because it's not a dapp and

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.400
What I think it is, is the DAO

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.029
The DAO,  the DAO's dead? long live run the DAO! (laughs)

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.540
What?

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.090
What is the essence of Ethereum?

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.320
to me? it's

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.249
Smart contracts right where do people usually use contracts most contracts most contracts?

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.339
I've ever signed most contracts I've ever written are

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.130
For business-to-business interactions a I sign some contracts as a consumer

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.510
But I do far more contracts through my businesses contracts are what make businesses run

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.860
So and there's a particularly interesting aspect to that which is that

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.080
Private commercial contracts between two businesses are not subject to anybody's regulation. I can choose what jurisdiction

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.520
I want to operate in I can choose my choice of law and as long as it is an affair between my

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:27.129
Corporation and another corporation. It's nobody's business what we write in that contract

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:34.538
That's a wide open space. It doesn't offend regulators. It doesn't get into the side of business and governments

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:41.109
It's just kind of neutral. It's nice, and there's a particular type of contract. That's the most interesting which [is]

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:47.709
The very basic contract the first contract you should do in any business. What's the first contract you [should] do in any business?

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.370
articles of organization

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.390
it's

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.579
The hey partner don't screw me over and run away with all the money contract

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:05.139
Right it's how you make sure that the people you are forming this association this venture this

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.919
vehicle are

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:12.158
Going behave the way you expect them to behave. That's the first contract the corporation itself

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:15.189
is a contract in

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:20.349
That contract is the most critical contract because that's the opportunity where Ethereum can

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.760
reinvent what it means to be a corporation in the Modern world the very essence of a corporation the

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.780
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.780
That's the killer app

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:37.689
It's the space that regulators don't care about for the most part

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:45.099
it's the space where you have the greatest freedom to invent completely new ways, systems, for humans to organize on A

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.410
massive scale

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.500
It's Ethereum's moonshot. It's

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:58.448
the possibility of taking this to a whole new level taking it into a moon orbit, if you like?

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:01.269
There's a problem with that

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:07.659
That is the order to moon orbit requires rocket science and writing Smart contracts [organized] corporations is

00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:10.449
Rocket science

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So, what is the essential

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.670
understanding of rocket science? it is that fundamentally there is very little difference between

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.130
a rocket and a bomb

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.989
In terms of fundamental chemistry a rocket is a very large

00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:35.739
Exothermic reaction the difference between a rocket to the bomb is that a rocket is a controlled

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.579
Exothermic reaction where all of the output is directed in a very specific direction, right?

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:50.649
think of that as governance, so it's a bomb of governance right that's the difference a

00:09:52.189 --> 00:09:56.229
Rocket is what happens when you do governance on explosives?

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.329
the problem is

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:04.299
The way people see the awesome power of a rocket, most of the time

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.810
[they're] really excited by the big boom

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:15.969
possibility the explosive side of things and this also applies the smart contracts because in Smart contracts money is the

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:24.120
fuel and the smart contract is governance and the rocket science of a smart contract is ensuring that the fuel of

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.769
Money that is managed by the smart contract doesn't blow up in your face

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.720
so

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.870
When you're doing rocket science is very

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:40.049
Disappointing when Stevie your neighbor decides to strap a lawn chair

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:45.599
to one hundred and fifty thousand kilograms of highly explosive fuel and

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.839
Says, "I shall conquer human spaceflight!" (audience laughs)

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.719
They don't think governance is so important! (audience laughs)

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.509
And what happens when you blow [up] that form of human spaceflight?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:07.230
The problem is it will forever mar the idea of human spaceflight

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.780
From that moment on anybody who was searching for the term human spaceflight

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.479
Will go online and the first result will be a YouTube video of Stevie boy

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:25.380
Creating a ginormous crater in their backyard and [turning] themselves [into] Stevie [mist]

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.000
because while they have the kinetic energy

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:37.440
captured in [a] hundred and fifty thousand kilograms of highly explosive fuel they forgot about the governance and the

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.909
governance is the killer app it's how you take funds and

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:49.409
Manage them how you take the energy of a community and manage it how you reinvent the corporation

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:55.920
Every time you think about writing a DAO. There's this little siren call that says

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.430
We could raise a lot of money with this thing

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.060
Resist that call

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.459
Because the way you achieve

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:13.799
The awesomeness of a moon orbit with ethereum is by a very careful very

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.090
conservative Governance

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:22.980
Then iterates and matures over [a] long period of time that is a killer app that can change how we do

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.440
Corporations but in order to do that

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:31.529
You must make sure to put too much fuel [if] you try to build an a plus five on day one

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.690
you will make a big crater and

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.500
You'll keep doing that for as long as you decide, but the first step is moon orbit

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:47.100
Let's not do moon orbit. How about low earth orbit right how about getting off the launch Pad?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.690
How about a horizontal harness engine test?

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.890
and

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.060
That's really the challenge with ethereum right now

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:03.329
But also the tremendous opportunity the killer app is smart contracts that we define the Modern corporation

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.109
the DAO the decentralized autonomous

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.149
Organization and if you go search for the dao, what do you find?

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.990
Stevie Boy blowing himself up into a giant Crater

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.529
so it's actually ruining the opportunity to do the killer app because

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.510
The opportunity to put a lot [of] fuel into [that] tension

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:34.019
[overlook] the Maturity of the governance, and what we need is a lot more work on the maturity of the governance

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.180
But to those who do that work

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.850
It's going to take 20 years to get the overnight success, but one day

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.829
That vehicle is going to go into [a] moon orbit. Thank you

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.410
you

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.470
you
