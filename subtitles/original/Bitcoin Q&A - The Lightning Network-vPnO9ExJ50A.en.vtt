00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
In legal terminology, this looks like an assignment of

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.700
claims. [...] So I was wondering , what happens if a party

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.700
does not [deliver] on these terms?

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.580
Isn't this a basis for smart contracts?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.840
Why would anyone want to do this?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.020
What is the incentive [for an intermediary]?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.360
If somebody wants to use a route with low transaction

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.000
costs but also has less hops,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.020
won't that introduce more settlement

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.180
costs on the blockchain?

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.000
About further on-chain scaling, wouldn't this push

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.180
transaction fees away from the miners and thereby

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.220
compromise on the long-term security model?

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.900
Will the Lightning Network be compatible with Bitcoin Unlimited?
