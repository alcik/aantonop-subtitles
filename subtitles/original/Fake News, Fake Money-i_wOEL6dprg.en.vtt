Today's talk, the title is: Fake news. Fake Money, and Living in a World Without Authority"

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:10.630
so

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.210
fake news has been in the news, a lot, lately and

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.559
you have all of these accusations swirling around, right?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.059
the established media, The New York Times, The Washington Post

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.299
They're pointing fingers and going these purveyors of fake news

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.359
primarily at internet-based sites

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.169
and internet-based sites are pointing right back

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:39.790
and going

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.959
Do you remember Judith Miller? Anybody who remembers Judith Miller?

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:44.920
Yeah

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.690
"There are WMDs, with aluminum tubes, in Iraq"

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.399
bullshit

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.399
so fake news

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.789
Happens on both sides right, and that's really the perplexing thing. How did we arrive in a world

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.789
where we can't even tell what's true

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.269
and what isn't?

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.658
You see well established

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.849
backbones of Authority and truth like the Washington Post in The New York Times or even CNN

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.490
Fox News and other TV

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:26.159
CBS and ABC, and what are they doing? They're cheerleading for a war based on false premises

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400
and that was just last week

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.610
again

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.069
Not Iraq, Syria this time, right? You're like. Did we learn nothing?

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.258
Did we learn nothing? We didn't learn anything. How did we arrive at this world?

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.809
why do we have this debate over fake news?

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.329
and part of it has to do with the rise of the internet in the early 90s

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.049
so work with me here. Let's walk through the steps

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.989
the internet didn't disrupt newspapers and TV companies

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.210
by

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.299
stealing their audience for news

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.360
That came much, much later

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.709
first

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.709
the internet

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.249
disrupted their sources of most profitable revenue

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.988
and for newspapers that was the classified advertising section. That was where they made most of their money

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.289
small business advertising in the classified section

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.060
and the internet came along and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.640
and Craig Craiglisted that shit, right? Just completely undermined it. Ah! you can do all of that free, and it's instantaneous

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.880
and boom, and suddenly

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.009
all of the most profitable revenue disappears

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.769
and the newspapers

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.760
have to adapt

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.769
And then happened again with TV. They started losing

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.029
advertising revenue to the new popular websites that were getting more eyeballs

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.580
so they started losing first

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.169
the local and small advertisers, who were able to position ads targeted to specific

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.389
demographics and audiences, because they could get much more fine-grained information. TV is a one-way thing, you have no idea who's watching, right?

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.920
and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.839
with the internet they could really target advertising, so TV starts losing

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.899
advertising revenue too. So what do they do? You know, trim the fat, right? Trim the fat

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.950
so in newspapers that's a

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.429
Journalist, we don't really need them. So, no foreign desk, cut that

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.560
Investigative journalism, cut that. You know. What's selling more papers?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.200
you know "Ask Judy" and the astrology section and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.980
infotainment, and cartoons, and sensationalist news, and if it bleeds it leads

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.549
and

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.660
inexorably the long

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.950
downtrend of

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.179
the news industry started, they gutted their foreign desks. They gutted their investigative journalism

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.209
They gutted their fact-checking, they  gutted their copy editor desks, until what was left was

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.090
a bunch of interns running around

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.169
copying the press releases of powerful corporations and presenting them as fact

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.529
and taking notes when someone who seemingly was important said something, not questioning any of it and just writing it down pushing it as truth

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.920
fake news happened

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.970
because

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.930
the very basis for producing truth

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.200
was removed from the very institutions whose job it was to produce truth

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.079
and this caused the very weird situation

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.900
Because until that time

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.109
How do you know if something's true? Well?

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.600
The New York Times said it, The Washington Post said it, it was on CBS

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.590
Surely they have fact checked it, therefore, it's the truth

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.979
The fundamental basis for discovery of truth was to examine the source

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.569
You go to college. You're writing an essay. They say

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.219
What are you basing this argument for? Give me citations, source your argument. Where are the facts?

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.679
and if you took a headline from the New York Times, and sourced it, they go "Ok great, That's a citation

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.779
that's valid, it's a valid source"

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.590
We used the issuer

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.719
to determine the quality of what they issued, we looked at the

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.670
authority of the news based on the authority of the institution that said it

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.639
Because that was a good model

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.469
that was a good heuristic. That gave us a good false positive false negative ratio. It was a bet,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.640
it was a way to say I can't fact check all of that, but these people have, so

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.190
if I read I

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.450
I will become not only educated, but also informed

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.039
And now we're in a situation where the people who watch the most TV and read the most newspapers are

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.800
the least informed part of the electorate

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.040
How did that happen?

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.099
Because the institutions are still standing

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.749
their authority is still standing, in some ways

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.469
The basis of credibility is still there

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.599
They still have the big buildings, lots of circulation and big name

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:44.130
But the mechanism that delivers truth is no longer there, the mechanism that ensured quality is no longer there

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.920
or is significantly eroded

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.969
and what's their response to that? We'll try harder?

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.069
No, they turn, they look at the internet, and they go: "you're fake news"

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.710
and

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:07.260
arguably a lot of the stuff on the internet is fake news, because it never had any of the mechanisms of producing truth

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.069
but the internet that has none of the mechanisms, and the newspapers that no longer have any of the

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.249
mechanisms are now producing truth on a relatively equal basis

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.299
every now and then some blogger uncovers some incredible story that nobody has noticed, and it is the truth

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:32.399
and the networks pick it up, and every now and then, the institutions of traditional truth fall flat on their face

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.870
and deliver bullshit to us

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.899
packaged in a fancy name

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.039
and people start questioning whether they should believe anything

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.600
What's the option? Where do you go from here?

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:53.969
Do you have to evaluate every fact for yourself? Do you have to build into your critical thinking the fact-checking department that they fired?

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.859
How do you go about evaluating every piece of knowledge

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.610
as fact or fake news

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.960
well

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.960
there's an easy heuristic

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.120
if the esteemed leader of your political party says it's fake news, it's fake news

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:20.580
Now we outsourced fact-finding to the tribe that we belong to. If the tribal leader

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.390
says that those guys are lying, we just go with it. Right?

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.570
happens Bitcoin too

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.250
Tribalism is part of the human nature

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:36.490
But what's really interesting

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:44.250
Is that what just happened in news, that has left an entire generation of people now unable to discern truth from fiction

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.040
easily manipulated through propaganda

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.560
What I'm going to suggest today, is that this is about to happen to money

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.780
This is about to happen to money. How do you know

00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:02.110
money is valuable?

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:08.369
I get asked this question every time I do a seminar about Bitcoin, especially if there's people in the audience who are new. They say but

00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:10.979
Bitcoin isn't backed by anything

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.839
This thing I have in my pocket, It says

00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:20.428
Central Bank of blah blah, it's backed by

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:27.539
the Nation, the Queen, the King, the Parliament, the GDP of my country

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:32.699
or the gold that we have in our vaults.
(You don't have any gold in your vaults!)

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:39.568
They still think there's gold in the vaults! Many people do. It's a common misconception

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.170
Most of my understanding of money comes from myth

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:48.479
it is just barely removed from the level of myth that is

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:55.679
Santa Claus. We have this constructed fantasy about money that we have received as children,

00:09:56.499 --> 00:10:01.079
and then as adults, when we notice in consistencies we kind of just shore it up with some

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:04.618
rusty nails and some planks to keep it in place

00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:11.219
And we try to keep the the illusion, and as part of that we adopt these preposterous ideas

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:18.419
such as: oh there's gold in the vaults, so then if the yeah, it's it kind of works. I don't know, now

00:10:18.999 --> 00:10:22.859
go make your room. Don't ask me any more questions, honey. I don't understand money either

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:30.269
We had a heuristic and the heuristic was

00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:33.059
if a stable, democratic,

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.899
government, based on some broadly free principles

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:41.849
sanely manages the economy. If they say it has value, it has value

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:47.279
And that's a great heuristic that removes the necessity for us to independently evaluate

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:52.979
Every note that comes into our hands, you know will this still be worth 20 dollars tomorrow?

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:59.458
Okay, not this one because this one was counterfeit as I told you before, but this other one, this one's real

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:07.499
Will this still be worth $20 tomorrow? Yeah? It will be worth $20, may not buy you $20 in today's money

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.250
maybe it will buy you

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:13.169
$19.80 in a year, and you don't really notice that, so that's okay

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.099
But you trust, you trust that it's still going to be there

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.910
unless you're Greek

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.800
or

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:30.930
Cypriot, or Venezuelan, or Argentinian, or Brazilian, or from Zimbabwe, or from the Ukraine, or from

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.849
You know, just keep adding to that list. It happened so many times

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.979
one day you wake up and you discover that the banks are closed, and

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:47.789
the bank governors on TV, and they say: "people don't panic everything is under control"

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.390
And when a government official says that, you know..

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.510
PANIC!

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.520
That's the time!

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.929
...to panic. Now it's about who gets to line up in front of the bank, because they're not opening next week as they promised

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.830
The temporary emergency measure will become a permanent emergency measure

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.619
guaranteed, every time, so line up and run for your money in the bank

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.039
and suddenly the institution of money has crumbled

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.950
and now what do you trust?

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:27.930
Now you go back to basics, things that you can examine and validate for yourself: gold, chicken, rice, salt, sugar

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.570
Whatever you can get your hands on, or that other country's money

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.859
US Dollar is hard currency, right?

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:44.429
and so the concept of money is one of those things that primarily holds value, because we attribute

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:51.660
the value as a direct result of its issuance by trusted Authority, and we outsource our own

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:57.900
determination of value to this trusted third party. And what happens when that trusted third party

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.210
stops delivering on that promise?

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:06.389
On purpose, by accident, through mismanagement, or deliberately, who knows?

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.060
But one day

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:17.360
that phrase that seemed so meaningful and strong and

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.920
satisfying

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.940
"The Full

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.940
Faith and Credit

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:28.170
of the

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.170
United States

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:32.209
Government"

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.520
America!

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:43.520
The Full Faith! not just some of the faith, the full faith and credit of the entire United States of America

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:50.479
satisfying, okay compare it to this one: "The Full Faith and Credit of The

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.720
National Bank of Zimbabwe"

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:03.589
Do you cry? do you laugh? Do you run? What do you do at that point? that sentence

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:08.929
no longer has much weight to it, right? That thing that you put all your faith in

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:15.889
Because they give you their full faith and credit, and in return, you give all of your full faith and credit

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.520
in return

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.549
Every time you receive one of those bills

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.520
you are giving credit

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:27.229
You're giving them a product or service in return for the bill. That's credit

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.299
You're giving faith, your full faith and credit, and your full faith and credit is based on

00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:36.829
absolutely no rational thinking other than you somehow believe in

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.730
this thing that's printed on it, "The Full Faith and Credit"

00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:43.770
I have a prediction

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.309
This sentence is going to become increasingly untenable

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.990
not just in the hot spots, not just in the back waters

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:57.409
Not just in the developing nations, in the third world as we used to call them, but in many places simultaneously

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:01.279
220 Trillion dollars of debt

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:09.020
say that the phrase "the full faith and credit" is ringing hollow all around the world, and what happens

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.320
when they can no longer shore it up?

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.039
Because Bitcoin is not going after

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.219
replacing National currencies, oh no

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.419
is doing something far more dangerous

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.829
It's encouraging people to put their savings

00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:39.229
outside the system, and that is the worst thing you can do to assist them, based on "full faith and credit". We are taking away

00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:42.529
the Credit and the

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:44.370
Faith

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.370
by presenting an alternative

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:53.809
that some people will find more useful, and in some places where the full faith and credit of the national currency has

00:15:54.449 --> 00:15:56.479
been damaged they will flock to

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.510
Bitcoin as a

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.719
valuable alternative, because they know

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.370
that it's safer, and we're seeing that happen. We saw it happen

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:12.589
in masses after November 8th in India when

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.809
Narenda Modi demonetized 86% of

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.729
the Country's money

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.199
Where's the faith now? no full faith?

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:34.729
Can you print on the money: "The 14% faith and credit of the National Bank of India"?

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:42.649
we took out 86% so that leaves 14%. "This money is backed by the 14 percent of faith and credit of the...

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.679
...of the national bank of India" Doesn't sound so good, people flock to Bitcoin

00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:53.239
So just like it wasn't bloggers

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:59.059
challenging the truth of news that created

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.430
this

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:09.530
dichotomy of fake news. It wasn't better news gathering that undermined the newspapers

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.429
it was

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:14.779
indermining their advertising revenue, cutting off their feet

00:17:15.419 --> 00:17:22.999
Cutting off at the knees, really. And then forcing them to adjust their news gathering to the new level of income they had

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.869
What happens when Bitcoin does that to banks?

00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:32.089
because when they say "close all the doors, and keep all the money in"

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:38.000
And there's one door they can't close, Because it's Bitcoin and the money keeps leaking

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.280
and leaking, and they say: "put the minister on television!"

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.969
"Tell them everything is going to be fine"

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:54.800
"The Yuan will not be devalued any further, the full faith and credit of the people's bank

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.940
of China is

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.140
behind this currency" And then a month later

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:06.439
it's devalued another half percent, and that's happened eight times the past year and at some point

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.440
you're like that doesn't count anymore

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.670
I'm taking my money elsewhere,

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:17.300
and a few people do, and a trickle of billions of dollars is fled into Bitcoin, from the Yuan

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:24.379
and the insidious damage it's doing is not in offering a better way for Chinese people to buy things,

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.610
to invest in companies, to transact with each other

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:32.178
it's undercutting the very source of revenue

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.820
and value

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.820
and stability of a national currency

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.329
by removing the full faith and credit of the people, and putting it in an alternative currency. By taking their savings

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.790
and instead of putting it in a deposit account, where it becomes the basis for fractional reserve lending

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:57.739
they're sucking liquidity out of the economy, and that is the worst thing you can do with an economy like that

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:09.410
So what are they doing next? What the hell can they do now? 
Drag the finance minister on TV...

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.720
"Dear Citizens

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.210
Drug dealers,

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:19.890
terrorists,

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.360
pornographers,

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.420
criminals, and most importantly

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.130
those really nasty people who live in the country next door

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.520
are undermining our nation

00:19:32.429 --> 00:19:34.429
through this

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.880
fake

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.710
currency Bitcoin

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.710
the fake money!"

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.509
"They are in a criminal conspiracy to damage our economy"

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:52.969
"Don't trust it. Do not invest your money in this Bitcoin. It's fake money. It's backed by nothing"

00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:01.249
"Fake money, fake money, fake money" they cry and scream and protest. "Fake money!"

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.189
You think that's not happening? It's happening right now

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.850
watch

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:11.329
Translate if you like, what a Venezuelan said about Bitcoin just a few months ago

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:19.459
"Fake money" In fact, they said it's the Colombians doing it

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:27.949
Right? It's always the weirdos next door who speak with a funny accent, and you know

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.119
soft tacos instead of hard tacos! Abomination!

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.980
and

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.469
So the cry starts slowly at first. "Fake money, fake money, fake money"

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:45.829
Bitcoin is considered fake money in a few places in the world. Where do you think it's considered fake money?

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.729
Not here. Nobody's called Bitcoin fake money here

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.969
Certainly no official would do that. They'd rather it

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.709
remain an obscurity. But in Venezuela Bitcoin is fake money.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.579
In Zimbabwe Bitcoin is fake money, and they write articles about it.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.809
In China

00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:08.119
they've tried it a few times. Hasn't played very well with the audience

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.290
In the absence of Institutional Authority

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.159
there is no basis for evaluating whether money is real or not. or is there?

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.819
and what is fake money and real money? who knows ?

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:28.400
are we back in the same cunundrum? are we back in the same

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:35.480
situation where we can no longer tell the difference? Is this just like fake news? Do we all have to discover the truth for ourselves?

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.130
No

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.809
because money has markets

00:21:39.809 --> 00:21:46.428
and markets discover truth, that's what they do. That's what a market does

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.860
So if you want to know if Bitcoin is fake money, or the Bolivar is fake money

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.190
You have an easy test

00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.140
You take your Bitcoin and you take your Bolivar, and you take them to someone on the street

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.199
and you say: how much will you give me for this?

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:10.820
and if the official exchange rate for the Bolivar is five times less than the unofficial exchange rate

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:16.279
and if the official exchange rate for Bitcoin carries a 20% premium

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.029
The market is telling you exactly which money is fake

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.130
the market discovers truth

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.980
and no matter how many pronouncements, and currency controls, and bank bands, and bank holidays

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:37.309
and demonetization incidents you do. No matter how big you try to make that wall. that dam

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:43.519
once it's got a little flow, a little pinprick, and water is flowing through, it will make that hole bigger

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:49.010
and the truth will come out. And the truth will be evaluated by the market, and you can call

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.269
Bitcoin fake money and the Market will say

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.830
"well, I'd rather take that fake money than your fake money"

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.130
on November 8th

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.869
in India, the price of Bitcoin went up and maintained

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.570
a 22% premium

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.100
against the Rupee

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.250
Over any other currency in the world

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.150
and

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.150
I was asked,

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.230
when I went to India

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.740
"Why is Bitcoin so expensive here?"

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.520
"Why is Bitcoin so expensive?"

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.549
Are the exchanges making

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.990
obscene profits?

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:37.429
No, they're not. They're not allowed to do arbitrage. Individuals are doing the arbitrage, and so I explained:

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.529
It's not the Bitcoin that's too expensive, if I go down

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.030
the street right now

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:50.000
with US dollars and buy Bitcoin, the price that they will give me is the exact same price

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.119
I can get in San Francisco. Bitcoin's price is exactly the same

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:59.179
but if I give them rupees, they're going to want 22% more rupees. It's not the Bitcoin price that went up

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:04.490
It's the Rupee's discount that went up. The Rupee price collapsed by 22%

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:11.720
because Bitcoin could be moved across borders to settle the arbitrage difference. And then you're stuck with Rupees

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.620
and you can't move them. And the fact that you can't move them

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:22.879
imposes an immediate 20% discount. That money is worth 20% less, because it is not portable

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:29.120
and portable is one of the three characteristics of what makes currency, and you just lost one of them

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.240
..actually two, because you demonetized most of it

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:42.559
Rupees are trading at a discount against Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the stable price. The market is telling you:

00:24:44.429 --> 00:24:47.929
"This is more real money than that stuff"

00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:52.309
and so the market discovers truth, and it tells us

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.689
But be ready because we're going to start hearing this again, and again, and again, as economies collapse

00:25:01.139 --> 00:25:08.659
as currencies get into crisis, and it's happening even in developed nations, is happening in the European union, it could happen here in the US dollar

00:25:08.659 --> 00:25:10.659
Who knows?

00:25:11.159 --> 00:25:18.859
The markets are trying to correct the situation, and they're going to create a flow of money going out into Bitcoin. People will start removing

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:27.320
their full faith and credit from the system and putting it in Safe Haven assets. Gold, silver, Bitcoin, whatever and

00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:30.259
as soon as that happens

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:35.899
you'll start seeing the articles in the newspapers, in the news media. You know, the fake news

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.779
telling you about the fake money

00:25:39.629 --> 00:25:46.339
and maybe you can tell the truth about what is fake news, and what isn't fake news

00:25:46.889 --> 00:25:50.749
But you can always tell the truth about what is real money

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:55.789
and what is fake money. And the easiest way to find out is to go out on the street

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:03.560
and ask the market, and the market will tell you the truth. 
Thank you
