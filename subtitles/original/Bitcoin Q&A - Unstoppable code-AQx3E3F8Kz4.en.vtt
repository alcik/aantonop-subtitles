00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
[AUDIENCE] Regarding the stalemate and
the way governance is going on with Bitcoin,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.080
do you think that could actually be jeopardizing
Bitcoin's market cap? Because right now,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.660
its market cap dominance with respect to
other altcoins has dropped below 70% now.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.560
[ANDREAS] Do I think that this scaling impasse is going to damage the long-term market share of bitcoin?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.560
No.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.400
I really don't. I think you'll see that Bitcoin's market share will climb and drop in a cyclical way.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.300
People will get disillusioned, they'll shift all
of their attention to another coin,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.460
which will then get overwhelmed with attention. Once it gets spotlight on it, it's going to say, "Look at us!

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.840
We're winning, we're winning - Oh shit, 
what happened? Oh, the DAO... Oops."

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.460
And then it all flows in the opposite direction. When the spotlight shifts, that's when you can't stumble.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.440
Right? And right now there's a lot of exuberance,
but they're going to stumble.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.220
Maybe if they managed an unbroken, non-stumbling record for the next five years? Yes.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.880
But no one can do that. This is real software, real money, real competition. It's an adversarial system.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.220
Everyone stumbles. Looking at Bitcoin and saying 
"Haha, they stumbled!" doesn't really solve anything.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.580
I don't like this adversarial attitude between the currencies. I think they all benefit from proving...

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.760
different points in this giant ecosystem, 
this community of currencies,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.720
where we can test out ideas in an evolutionary environment; where the forces of the market

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.660
are informing trade-offs and design decisions 
that cause each one of these little species

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:57.420
to specialize into one niche, thrive and 
conquer that environment. That's beautiful.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.520
It is basically one of the first Darwinian innovation labs, experimenting with real money.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.660
All of it's good. Even the failed experiments teach us something. I don't think bitcoin's market share loses...

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.460
because of that. I think it's just 
a cyclical phenomenon, but who knows?

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.320
Maybe Bitcoin suffers in other ways.
One thing I will tell you:

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.720
Being stuck in the status quo, being resistant 
to change, is a differentiable feature.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:42.460
It makes a system extremely robust against takeover, very difficult to shut down, co-opt, and corrupt.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.980
Its own damn developers can't change it, 
so how is an outsider going to attack it?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:59.300
We've got inside attacks from two fronts right now, and Bitcoin is [building] the valid greatest cumulative...

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.980
difficulty chain every ten minutes. No sweat.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.140
That's resistance to change. That's a design characteristic. Bitcoin was designed to do this.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.300
It was designed to say, "Unless everyone agrees, 
we're not changing a thing."

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.600
That's what makes it resistant to attack. 
Guess what? Attack is coming.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.100
This is becoming more and more important to the world. The more important it gets, the more interests it offends,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.580
and the more of those interests are going to try to attack it in every way: political propaganda, economic,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.980
electrical, network, every way.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.220
The fact that even its own developers 
can't force change from the inside,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.960
even its own miners can't 
force change from the inside...

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:52.140
They're just sitting, staring at each other, saying 
"I will- grrr... do something if you don't do what I say!"

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.080
And they can't figure out what that "something" is, because within the rules they can't actually do it.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.340
That is an evolutionary trait Bitcoin has. If you think that's a disadvantage, take your money to another coin,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.440
and see what happens when it gets really interesting and really important.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.280
I like this "play with me for a while," this mental exercise.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.840
What is the slogan for Ethereum?
Running unstoppable code.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.840
Yeah? What kind of code do you 
want to run that's unstoppable?

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:40.640
Code that somebody is trying to stop.
I can't remember who said this quote,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.460
but he said, "The only things worth printing
are things that others are trying to suppress.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.640
Everything else is advertising." Some journalist,
playwright, or brilliant person [said this]."

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.520
The only codes worth running as "unstoppable code" 
is code that someone is trying to stop.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:11.220
That's a great feature until you put it in practice.
Bitcoin received this massive negative reputation...

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.360
hit from Silk Road, because it was the money used on Silk Road. Silk Road itself was running on Linux.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.700
What happens when it's running on Ethereum,
when Ethereum is both the money and the platform?

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.040
"Unstoppable code!"

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.560
Look, we're running a black market. 
It's unstoppable code! Oops?

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.680
Immediately, everybody's going to say,
"Uh, excuse me? Stop that!"

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.340
What do you do then? Hard fork? Stop it? 
Or continue with unstoppable code?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.300
Now you've got a problem. If Ethereum actually fulfills its vision, it will eventually run some unstoppable code...

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.360
that someone wants to stop. They're going to 
ask Ethereum developers to stop it.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.440
Then we'll see who's resilient or not.
If they stop it, then it's no longer unstoppable code.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:13.320
If they don't stop it, then we've got another problem. Now all those banks in the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance...

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.480
say the magic words: "Well, we're not so much
interested in Ethereum as we are in the technology...

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.760
behind Ethereum - smart contracts."
They start running as far away as possible,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.160
to get away from the [public relations] nightmare 
that Ethereum has just become.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.380
Right? Just like they did with the Silk Road.
"It's not Bitcoin, it's Blockchain."

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.940
You go to conferences and they have the title "Blockchain Beyond Bitcoin." Really? Okay.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.780
Who here has done a blockchain transaction?
Anybody here own a blockchain?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.200
Oh, really? It doesn't exist? Interesting.
Based on the conferences, I thought

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:03.540
Bitcoin died and "Blockchain" 
is the only thing that exists.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.980
Wait until all of the conferences are 
talking about "Smart Contract Chain."

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:18.280
It's like Ethereum, only without the unstoppable code. Brought to you now with stoppable code.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:26.040
The new Ethereum 2.0, now with stoppable code.
Did you like smart contracts,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.100
but wanted it to be stoppable code?
We'll stop it for you.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.040
In fact, we now have a committee-driven system where you can apply for [contracts to be stopped].

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:44.960
They will apply an estoppel on the code. I'm not kidding. This is exactly what is going to happen.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:51.000
Mark my words. The video tape's right there. Come back in three years and tell me it didn't happen.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:08:03.840
That's okay. That's trial-by-fire.
Bitcoin is surviving because it can't be changed,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:10.020
because it really is "unstoppable code."
Thank you! We'll wrap it up there.
