00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.310
"First do no harm."

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.830
Who said that?

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.660
Hippocrates?

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.000
Actually, he didn't.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.040
The Hippocratic oath, which is one of the
mainstays of medicine, starts with

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.880
"first, do no harm."

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.380
It expresses the principle of minimization,
the principle of utility.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.920
This utilitarian philosophy says that before
you try to fix things, make sure you're not

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.460
making them worse.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.640
Ironically, Hippocrates - the father of medicine
- didn't say this.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.199
It wasn't part of the Hippocratic oath or
part of Hippocrates' writing.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.869
It was added after the introduction of modern
science in the mid 19th century.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:54.979
"First do no harm."

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:02.269
Because some things are not just useless,
they're worse than useless.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.840
They actually do harm.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.980
That is title of my talk today:
"Worse than Useless."

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.140
Hippocrates was actually a big proponent of
blood-letting.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.840
Blood-letting was a practice that started
in the ancient Mediterranean region, that

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:31.420
involved balancing the humours in the body
by bleeding people out slowly.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.390
The idea was that the various fluids in the
body need to be balanced - kind of like a

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.979
hydrodynamic system.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:49.600
Before modern science started thinking of
our body as a machine that's made of clockwork,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.060
which is the 19th and 20th century visualisation
of science.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.659
The ancients saw "science" as a matter of
essences, of humours.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.420
Earth, fire, water, air.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.179
Part of the idea of blood-letting was, if
these things are out of balance, you need

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.150
to release some blood to bring things into
balance.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.530
This practice continued all the way through
into the 19th century.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.209
One of things I love is that one of the most
famous victims of blood-letting was one of

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.120
the Founding Fathers of the United States:
George Washington.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.810
Late in his life, George Washington woke up
one day with a sore throat and he was a big

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.370
fan of blood-letting as a medical practice.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.879
He invited his doctors / butchers to do a
nice blood-letting.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.269
Over the next four days, they bled about seven
pints of blood out of him.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:08.019
The historical record is this: "Despite the
treatment, he passed four days later."

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.310
Some of us might say "because of the treatment,
he died four days later."

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:21.340
It's an irony and this practice continued
for 2,500 years.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.510
Why is it important to remember this concept
of "do no harm"?

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.709
Because unless you follow the scientific method,
many of the common practices that we apply

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:43.030
today are based not on science, but on superstition,
anecdote, wishful thinking, and righteous

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.230
morality.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:56.970
One of those is financial surveillance and
the system of KYC/AML rules.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.349
The modern system of banking, brought into
being by the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, is

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.470
a creation that bears no scrutiny from science.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.000
It is based on the righteous moral thinking
that "bad people" should not have access to

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.420
money and as long as we trust those in authority
to tell us who the bad people are (and assume

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.170
they themselves are not the bad people), then
everything will work out.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:33.850
If you criticise this idea, you're not presented
with facts, data, or science.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:41.591
You are accused of not being morally righteous
enough to understand that we must (for all

00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:47.070
reasons) "protect the children."

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.700
Won't somebody please think of the children?

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.290
Because there are criminals out there.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.460
There are bad people, and if bad people can
use money they might use it to do bad things.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.200
It's very difficult to prosecute the bad things,
but it's a lot easier to prosecute the money.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.420
And so we do it.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.590
Does it work?

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.180
No.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.400
But if this practice was useless, that would
be good.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.500
Because it's not useless, it's worse than
useless.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.010
In fact, it does enormous harm.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.270
Part of the reason that billions of people
around the world have no participation in

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:37.520
the world economy, are financially excluded,
is directly related to this closed financial

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.560
system -- where authority is given to few
to decide who is "good" and who is "evil."

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.330
To decide who should have access to money
and who should not.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.800
It starts with the fundamental idea of identity
being a requirement for every endpoint of

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.380
every transaction.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:03.300
It is a system that will always exclude billions.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.270
In the age of the internet, we have come no
further in terms of financial inclusion.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.550
In fact, we are now backtracking.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:19.840
Entire countries, entire continents are disconnected
from the world economy in order to satisfy

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:27.240
the moralistic bourgeoisie idea that we are
safer if we allow bureaucrats to decide who

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.280
has access to money and who doesn't.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:41.070
Money laundering happens, money laundering
happens every day.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.800
But there are some who can money-launder without
consequences.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.500
In our modern world, there is such a thing
as a license to launder money: it's called

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.360
a banking license.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.530
As long as you have one of these magic licenses,
you can launder money all day long.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.270
Who is money laundering?

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:10.990
Of course conventional wisdom and common sense
will tell you it's the banks.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.340
They have the money, they launder.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.660
Obviously.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:21.770
If you actually look at the statistics, if
you look at the data, this is shown again

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.620
and again.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.170
Banks launder money.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.270
In fact, that's their main activity!

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:37.310
They launder money for governments, intelligence
agencies that fund terrorism; they launder

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.920
money for narco-traffickers.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.780
One of the hilarious examples of our modern
world was a certain enormous bank that had

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:54.660
modified their bank teller windows near the
northern border of Mexico, so they could precisely

00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:01.990
fit a Samsonite case (the favourite case of
drug money launderers) so that they could

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.740
stuff cash through the window conveniently.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.090
They wouldn't have to even unpack it.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.840
Of course, in those days the big drug cartels
were making so much money (and they still

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.460
are) that you don't count the money -- you
weigh it.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.850
It's faster.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.840
Who has time to count a truck full of money,
if you can just calculate the net weight in

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.500
dollars?

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.509
Money laundering is something that banks do
on a routine basis.

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:40.930
Every time they're caught, they pay a fine,
no one goes to jail, and banking continues.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:46.500
Which means that this a fundamental part of
business; it is rewarded with a series of

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:53.139
incentives to ensure that by playing these
fake regulations, they get to force the competition

00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:55.209
out of the game.

00:08:55.209 --> 00:09:01.290
One of the reasons that no one can compete
with traditional banking using technology

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.589
is because the regulations ensure they will
not be given an opportunity.

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:13.980
You must ask for permission first and the
answer is always "no" unless you can afford

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:21.060
a banking license, the license to money launder
and the fines that come with that as part

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.180
of doing business.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.470
Of course banks can afford it, because there's
one thing that banks do well and that's make

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.000
a lot of money.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.160
Worse than useless.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:41.150
The very basis of this model of modern finance
is an idea that should be so abhorrent to

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:46.100
free people as to be the topic of every conversation.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:52.279
We discuss the revelations from Snowden, the
revelations about broad-based surveillance

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:58.519
of all of our societies on the internet; yet
the elephant in the room, the thing we don't

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:06.399
discuss, is that the form of most pervasive
and intrusive surveillance that exists is

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:13.370
the international network of totalitarian
financial surveillance.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:21.660
Every time you use a debit card, a credit
card, a bank account, every transaction gets

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:31.620
funneled to every intelligence service and
every government that has access to this network.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:38.709
When people criticise Bitcoin, they say it
will "enable the dark net."

00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:41.300
What is the dark net?

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:48.760
Well, presumably the dark net is invisible
to most of us, operates on top of or in parallel

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:55.310
with the internet, and on which massive amounts
of illegal activity happen.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:03.889
If that is the case, the dark net's name is
ECHELON, PRISM, X-KEYSCORE.

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:06.319
Those are the names of the dark web.

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:11.999
The "dark net" is operated by intelligence
agencies because they are, on a daily basis,

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:15.490
committing massive crimes against human rights.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:21.269
They are orchestrating a totalitarian financial
surveillance network that monitors everybody's

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:29.560
transactions and (as a result) everybody's
location, purchasing preferences, political

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.009
preferences, and what kind of porn you watch.

00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:39.700
All of that is tied to your financial life,
because everything is tied to your financial

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.700
life.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:47.089
This system of totalitarian financial surveillance
is the "dark net."

00:11:47.089 --> 00:11:55.689
They don't fear the dark net, they just don't
want us to have one too.

00:11:55.689 --> 00:12:02.809
Worse than useless, because this system ensures
that 2.5 billion people live in the world with

00:12:02.809 --> 00:12:08.439
absolutely no access to financial services;
4 billion people if you count their families

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:13.009
and minimal access to the most basic financial
services.

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:18.279
If you really count the type of power banking
that a western person has, then 6 billion

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.980
people have much more limited access to that.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.079
This is what that system is about.

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:27.730
This is about the other 6 billion.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.209
Why does Bitcoin matter?

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:41.439
Because Bitcoin enables us to build a system
where we flip the traditional balance between

00:12:41.439 --> 00:12:44.209
what is secrecy and what is privacy.

00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:52.470
Privacy is what I have, not because someone
gives it to me but because I take it.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:13:01.220
Not because it was granted as a privilege,
but because it is my right as a human.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:06.790
I've had it from birth, I will have it forever.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.519
That is immediately suspect.

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:15.649
Secrecy is the ability of a government that
is supposed to be subservient to its voters

00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:23.509
and operate by the consent of the governed,
to instead bypass democratic control, auditability,

00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:31.379
and accountability so they can funnel billions
of dollars into black projects that fund terrorism,

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:35.259
that fund drug lords.

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:38.110
Who funds ISIS?

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.059
Our tax money does.

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:43.959
That's the uncomfortable truth.

00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:51.540
Not Bitcoin, but dollars and rubles and yuan.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.440
Money laundering is a government activity
supported by banks.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.089
Terrorism financing is a government activity
supported by banks.

00:14:02.089 --> 00:14:11.559
Yet they have the audacity to claim the idea
that people should be free to transact, participate

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:19.180
in a global economy, and exercise their birthright
of privacy, is going to cause the world to

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:24.040
descend into chaos, mayhem, anarchy.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:30.370
What happens when people can transact anonymously?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.129
Nothing happens.

00:14:33.129 --> 00:14:38.139
For thousands of years, people were transacting
anonymously.

00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:45.079
The greatest, most established, most private,
peer-to-peer network of payments is called

00:14:45.079 --> 00:14:46.790
cash.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.029
We've had it for thousands of years.

00:14:49.029 --> 00:14:53.350
Then suddenly, in the 70s, we decided this
was dangerous.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:15:01.470
Instead, we needed to move to a world of totalitarian
financial surveillance.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.970
That's what it is.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:08.560
It's all-encompassing, it's all-powerful,
it is all secret.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.810
That is what the word 'totalitarian' means.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.079
It is fascist.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:20.389
Yet somehow we have been persuaded that "for
the sake of the children," we must operate

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:27.730
in a world where every one of our transactions
is visible, but every one of their transactions

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.970
is private.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.870
I say that's the wrong way around; I say we
have to flip that equation and we have to

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.529
flip it fast.

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:44.190
The reason the world is in chaos is partly
because of that.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.129
You want to breed terrorism?

00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:54.699
Cut people off from the world economy, trap
them in poverty, remove justice, and what

00:15:54.699 --> 00:15:58.749
happens is war.

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:06.680
Martin Luther King Jr. said, "Peace is no
the absence of war, it is the presence of

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.420
justice."

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.160
Justice starts with the assertion of human
rights.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.670
What we are doing with Bitcoin is not just
playing with money, getting rich, trying to

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:27.110
create the next ICO or whale, the next overclass
of rich people who are going to lord over

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.740
everybody else.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.709
At least, that's not what I'm interested in.

00:16:31.709 --> 00:16:38.380
I'm interested in creating peace through justice;
justice starts with the ability of every human

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:49.079
being on this planet to transact freely, with
privacy, with anyone, anywhere, anytime.

00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:54.689
Uncensorable, unstoppable, anonymous.

00:16:54.689 --> 00:17:00.560
You think the fight over block size was bad?

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:10.430
You think a few people trying to disagree
with trolls and sockpuppets in social media,

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:17.880
throwing money around to influence opinion
on both sides was bad?

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:29.710
There are people right now who are working
on the next level of Bitcoin, including zero-knowledge

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.120
range proofs and confidential transactions.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:42.740
Massive-scale CoinJoins, onion-routed payment
channels which are completely anonymous, untraceable,

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.380
unstoppable.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.420
People ask me, "What do you think is the biggest
problem with Bitcoin?

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.390
Is it scaling?

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.930
Is it fraud?

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.160
Is it centralisation of mining?"

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.070
No, it's that we don't have enough anonymity.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.050
We don't have enough privacy.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:06.310
We better fix that before this gets too popular.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:12.870
Adoption of a platform with insufficient privacy
is extremely dangerous.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:18.940
If you're the only one doing anonymous transactions,
you're not anonymous.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.330
What we need is ubiquity of privacy.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:32.300
This should not be an option that I check
in my Samourai wallet that says 'Use Tor.'

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.850
It should be default on every wallet, every
time.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:42.810
There should be no transaction that isn't
confidential.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:53.010
Here's the interesting thing: if you ask the
banks whether they want anonymous transactions,

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.010
they absolutely do!

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:03.690
The "distributed ledger technology" is being
built with anonymity.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:13.190
They're using zero-knowledge range proofs,
mixers, and confidential transactions.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:22.230
They're trying to build confidential and anonymous
systems for settlement.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.760
Why?

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.790
Because they can't trust the motherfucker
sitting across the table from them, who run

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.150
the competitive bank.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:37.860
If they know what's happening on the network,
they will front-run every transaction, pump

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.840
and dump every asset.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.840
Why?

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.840
Because that's what they do every single day.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:52.280
Of course, since they can't trust each other,
they understand the need for privacy.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.980
They will build their private blockchains,
their clearing and settlement networks, and

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:09.960
they will make absolutely sure that they have
confidentiality, privacy, anonymity, deniability.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.300
They will make sure they have all of those
things so they can continue business as usual.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.650
They will achieve their secrecy.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:22.460
The question now is: will we get ours?

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.630
Will we assert our human right of privacy?

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:30.390
Will we use this technology not to enslave
the world through a totalitarian financial

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.690
surveillance system, but to free the world?

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:39.680
Will we do something that will first do no
harm?

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:47.920
Thank you. [applause]
